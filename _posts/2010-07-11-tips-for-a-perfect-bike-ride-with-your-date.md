  * Leave early in the morning as soon as the sun breaks.
  * Drive slow at the start, save your adrenaline for the fast one at the end.
  * Feed some soothing songs in some music player, share the earphones with your date.
  * Wear the helmet only if you have arranged one for your date as well, otherwise you may end up striking her head into your helmet every time you apply brakes.
  * Always choose the finished roads, even if the distance to be traveled across increases.
  * Study your path well before leaving and arrange some eye gears if required for that terrain.
  * Slow down or take small breaks when some scenic beauty arrives.
  * Leave the handle and ask her to handle the bike. (Note: Do so, only if you have good balancing skills)
  * While speeding, ask her to open her arms wide and inhale the fresh air as you lean down such that your chest almost reaches the bike&#8217;s tank.
