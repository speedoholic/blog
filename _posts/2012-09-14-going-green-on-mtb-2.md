I have always loved the concept of <a class="zem_slink" title="Mountain biking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">mountain biking</a> and with the increasing concern for environment, green biking has become popular.

Today while chatting with a colleague at I.T. park I came to know that he has been using an MTB to commute to the office. I had noticed a few more cyclists in Chandigarh before but I hadn&#8217;t got a chance to commune with any. After learning the gear shifts, I had a quick test ride in the parking lot and got amazed with its performance. The disc brakes were good enough to perform a rookie stoppie which prompted my idea of buying an MTB. Though I am not a fan of roadster bikes, if you give me a proper MTB I might even ditch my motorcycle. I won&#8217;t just be saving my fuel money but would also become a part of  the green family of futurists without letting go of my passion for thrill.

_P.S.: As I have just started off with my professional life, I would like to plan more before investing._
