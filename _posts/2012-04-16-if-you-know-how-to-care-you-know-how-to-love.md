This weekend I was lucky enough to watch some Korean movies. I have waited for my training to get over, so that I could continue downloading such movies on my laptop as they are not easily available in the market.
  
After late night party on Saturday I started streaming these movies on YouTube via wifi. With continuous browsing and comparing the comments I ended up watching these three movies in a row:

**Love A Holic**:
  
This emotive Thai movie depicted the problems of a married couple. It is full of emotional sequences with some effective comedy elements in between.
  
The boring lifestyle of the couple leads each of them to try other means of pleasure but they only end up feeling guilty.

The story has been twisted well and maintains the interest as several shots are connected to give a different meaning.

**Daisy**:

Few are the movies that can portray the feelings this well. Though as for Korean flicks I have experienced many.

The love and helplessness of an assassin who delivers daisy flowers to a girl daily, doesn&#8217;t change even when she thinks that the man she has waited for is a detective who was using her as a cover.

The craving for a person and the pain coz of losing the same are depicted well. The inability to express love is emotive.

This movie portrays the true meaning of love; To make sure that the person is happy is more important than getting him/her in your life.

P.S.: If you know how to care, then you know how to love.

**You&#8217;re my pet**:
  
As I have watched movies all night and was sleep deprived I decided to go for this Korean comedy flick.

An executive woman is having a human pet who is actually a famous ballet dancer.

There are many cute scenes between the master and her pet but this joy adds up to love eventually.

The characters portray innocence and purity other than the fact that the girl keeps lying about her pet. As it&#8217;s impossible to understand the complex mind of a girl; I can only guess that she couldn&#8217;t tell her boyfriend about it, as she was not sure about her feelings.
  
Still this reason doesn&#8217;t sound good enough to me, but then again her happiness would have mattered more than any justification.
