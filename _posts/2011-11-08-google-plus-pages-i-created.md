The <a title="The next web article" href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/11/07/google-launches-pages-for-google/" target="_blank">Google Plus Pages</a> just got rolled out and I couldn&#8217;t stop myself from trying my hand on them. Though I only wanted to test it, i ended up creating 5 pages.

The first was made for my <a title="Ashuraj Plastic industries on Gplus" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/115424744662388724529/posts" target="_blank">father&#8217;s company</a> and I recorded the screen while making it. You can watch the <a title="screenr" href="http://www.screenr.com/XaZs" target="_blank">screenr </a>here:

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
  <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"></span>
</div>

Just as I was going through pages created by other users, I decided to make one for <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/115665236663073912272/posts" target="_blank">my blog</a>.

Then I came across a page which was dedicated by a person to his pet.

So I thought, if people are making pages for their pets, why not I make one for <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117505920193298642341/posts" target="_blank">my motorcycle</a>. After all it is more important to me than a pet.

Well this page was solely for updates related to my motorcycle and being a motorcycling enthusiast I wanted to share more than that. So I created another page called &#8220;<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109700911796992026732/posts" target="_blank">Motorcycle Diaries</a>&#8221; which I am hoping to use for sharing updates about anything related to motorcycling.
  
I started off by sharing my blog post in which I wrote about my fantasy.

At last, I created the 5th page dedicated to my passion for Korean Movies. I gave it the same handle as it&#8217;s twitter counter part &#8220;<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117186226950065458026/posts" target="_blank">Kus Korea</a>&#8221; and shared some photographs that were already saved in my dropbox.

Right now, I am not sure whether I&#8217;ll be able to timely update so many pages or not. But I created them nevertheless.

The one thing that I noticed while doing all this is that, there is no functionality for sharing a post directly on my page while I am browsing as a Google Plus profile. Though I hope that they will add this feature soon, coz it would be too messy to switch between my profile and pages every time.
