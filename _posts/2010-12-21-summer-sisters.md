Never heard the name ‘<a class="zem_slink" title="Judy Blume" rel="homepage" href="http://www.judyblume.com">Judy Blume</a>’ before, but while browsing some novels at the Opulent Mall, I came across this novel with a tag saying it was a <a class="zem_slink" title="The New York Times Best Seller list" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list">New York Times Bestseller</a>. The novel had the title, “<a class="zem_slink" title="Summer Sisters" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Summer-Sisters-Judy-Blume/dp/0385324057%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0385324057">Summer Sisters</a>”. People often judge a novel by its title alone, but I preferred to read a little and get a taste of it. Eventually I ended up buying it. It was my idea for time pass while I travelled back and forth between <a class="zem_slink" title="Patiala" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=30.33,76.4&spn=0.1,0.1&q=30.33,76.4 (Patiala)&t=h">Patiala</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Delhi" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=28.61,77.23&spn=0.01,0.01&q=28.61,77.23 (Delhi)&t=h">Delhi</a> at weekends. At first I thought it was just another crude novel trying to entertain readers with descriptions of some alluring scenes but later I realized it was far more compulsive than I thought. It was warm, intriguing, nostalgic, moving and entertaining as hell. I was laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time. The story revolves around two characters called Caitlin and Victoria who are ‘summer sisters’ having a bond which is far peachier than what one could expect between real sisters. The conditions of their families and what they had to go through are realistic and striking.

_P.S. : I reckon this is an adult book for young adults!_
