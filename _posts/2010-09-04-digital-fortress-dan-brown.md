Dan Brown&#8217;s &#8220;_<a class="zem_slink" title="The Da Vinci Code (film)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code_%28film%29">The Da Vinci Code</a>_&#8221; had a hefty successor, this novel gained my interest from the very first page. Its about <a class="zem_slink" title="National Security Agency" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency">NSA</a> and cryptography. David Becker became my favorite character due to his tricks and instincts. Susan was the lovely <a class="zem_slink" title="Cryptography" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptographer</a> whose description often made the scenes more interesting. Strathmore seemed to be a lot more savvy than his director. The characters involved in the second half of the novel didn&#8217;t hold much importance. However, if you like computers and codes, this novel is good for you to read.
