I always believed that kids are supposed to be naggy and spending time with them means dealing with their cries and piss. But this notion got completely changed when I volunteered for <a title="official website" href="http://www.aashayeinfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Aashayein foundation</a> with the help of <a title="website" href="http://vidwan.in/" target="_blank">Vidwan</a>.
  
Me and my senior <a title="Fb profile" href="https://www.facebook.com/ashish.imt" target="_blank">Mr. Ashish Batra</a> met at Sri Sri Bal Vidyalaya primary schoolÂ for underprivileged kids situated near the BSNL exchange in RDC, Ghaziabad. He debriefed me about the cultural fest called &#8220;Khushi Ke Rang&#8221; we were supposed to organize. As we had only 2 days to prepare the head mistress was kind ofÂ charged up on us, but I later realized that it was just her way of getting the work done fast. While she continued toÂ hasten us, we maintained our cool and took care of all the arrangements one by one.Â The children had already prepared some of the performances which included songs, western and cultural dances. We analyzed their performances and decided the schedule so.

I got so mixed up with the kids that I started teaching them some dance steps by myself. It was an amazing experience as they were very obedient and worked hard until they got it right. Â Just while I was showing them one of theÂ masculine steps, a boy did a cart wheel right out of the blue. I wasÂ stunned because he was hardly 7 years old. Soon I realized that there was not just one but about 10 boys who could easily do this stunt flawlessly. To the addition of my amazement a girl did a cart wheel and then 2 more showcased this skill. Watching these little kids do it so easily, I thought that <a class="zem_slink" title="India" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=28.6133333333,77.2083333333&spn=10.0,10.0&q=28.6133333333,77.2083333333 (India)&t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">India</a> has really got some talent.

On the day of event, about 12 more volunteers came to the school to become a part of the fest. Each volunteer was assigned about 5 kids with whom they interacted and helped them during the drawing competition. We were dazzled by the marvelous drawings that these kids were making with utmost brilliance.Â All the drawing material was provided to the kids which was later donated to the school.

The kids were filled with joy and were very anxious to perform on the stage. After all the performances, the stage was declared open for dance. The kids who couldn&#8217;t perform earlier were patiently waiting for this moment and grabbed the opportunity in no time. The volunteers were also dragged on stage by the kids who were eager to copy each of their steps. Lunch and drinks were then distributed as the kids made a disciplined row on their own.
  
Another example of such discipline was noticed by me when one of the kids spilled his lunch. Normally a kid of that age would start crying or just start playing with it. But instead he got up, brought a broom and cleaned the mess on his own. I guess the hardships in their lives teach them to rely on themselves. This incident touched my heart and made me more sure about staying involved with the social work. Just imagine what these kids can do if only their basic requirements are fulfilled.

All in all this was a wonderful experience and I loved spending time with the kids. ðŸ™‚
