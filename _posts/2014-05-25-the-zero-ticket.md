For those who are in Chandigarh and frequent sector 17, next time you get a parking ticket near Neelam Theatre, have a look at the amount. It proudly displays the number that got its invention in India, ZERO. I am not sure if this is genetic or not, but I am a &#8220;Bania&#8221; and I do check the parking ticket to read the amount of fee I am supposed to pay. So last month I got my first zero ticket and as soon as I learned this, I went back to the counter and got a fresh ticket with correct amount mentioned on it. I thought it was just a mistake. Next time I parked, I noticed the same big oval shaped number smiling at me through the ticket. This time I was in a hurry and just ignored it. Today I got another zero ticket and I decided to ask the person sitting at the counter, &#8220;Why zero tickets everyday?&#8221; To this he replied, &#8220;We don&#8217;t mention the amount as it changes with the number of hours you park for.&#8221; As I was again running late, I took a quick snap of the ticket and thought maybe I could prove it to be a scam later. Coz the last time I checked, there was no hourly rate. Moreover, I didn&#8217;t see the collector take a glance at the time on my ticket. So if you are reading this or if you have been a victim of The Zero Ticket, do share your thoughts via comments. Maybe we could help the authorities understand that they can&#8217;t just run their parking in the memory of Aryabhatta! ðŸ˜‰
