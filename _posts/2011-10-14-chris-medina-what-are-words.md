    A post dedicated to Chris Medina&#8217;s song: &#8220;What are words&#8221; and the story that makes this song even more special.<br /> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:13px;font-weight:normal;"><em><br /> </em><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/whatarewords"><img src="http://i2.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/-1/lens18694573_1318542877intro.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="138" /></a></span>

    This is not just about the song but the love that is behind it. The power that gave Chris the courage to try consistently without loosing hope.</p> 
    
    <p>
      Chris Medina&#8217;s song &#8220;What are words&#8221; is not just another song.  This song actually represents his love for his fiance Juliana Ramos.<br /> She got into an accident on 2nd october 2009 which nearly killed her and since then she has been trying to relearn the most basic of tasks with the help of her family and Chris.<br /> She needs help of people around her even for walking, feeding and communicating. It is like the most horrible thing that one can go through and some consider it as even worse than death.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      No matter how insuperable this may seem, Chris has always been with her holding her hand when she needs him most.

      To empathize the things that Chris have done and what he and others related to his girl have been trying to do earnestly since such a long time, do have a look at this squidoo lens: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/whatarewords">http://www.squidoo.com/whatarewords<br /> </a><br />
