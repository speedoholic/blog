During the past few months I have spent a lot of time in office and the only time I spent with myself was in gymnasium.  I like to wear myself out during the day so that when I hit the bed at night I don&#8217;t have energy to think and can simply crash. As there were too many thoughts and too less of time to process them, I didn&#8217;t bother.

**23rd May 2013 (Thursday), 11 pm:**
  
It was not Friday but I got into the weekend mood, picked my motorcycle keys and stormed out. My backpack contained just a water bottle and my mobile charger. I was wearing the gloves as well as the mask which helped in holding the earphones in the right place. I had not decided where I would go yet, and simply turned on the music. The song made me pull the throttle harder and I was on the Himalayan Expressway in no time.  Learning from <a title="New Year Ride to Shimla" href="http://kushalashok.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/new-year-ride-to-shimla/" target="_blank">my last ride</a> to <a class="zem_slink" title="Shimla" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=31.1033333333,77.1722222222&spn=0.1,0.1&q=31.1033333333,77.1722222222 (Shimla)&t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Shimla</a>, I got the tank re-filled at the first petrol pump even though I almost missed it and had to take a U-turn.

Though I was driving at an average speed in the beginning, there was no looking back after crossing the <a title="Timber Trail Heights" href="http://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g1154161-d1172838-Reviews-Timber_Trail_Heights-Parwanoo_Himachal_Pradesh.html" target="_blank">timber trail</a>. Whether it be a truck driving on the wrong side or a fellow speedster overtaking on a curve, nothing could stop me. It was an assiduous effort to get high; as high as 2,444 m which I achieved eventually. Shimla was just 30 km away when I slowed down at a check-post and looked at the sign boards. The name &#8216;<a class="zem_slink" title="Chail, Himachal Pradesh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chail%2C_Himachal_Pradesh" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Chail</a>&#8216; struck me as I had heard about it from my friends and probably read about it online as well. This made me realize that I had never been to Chail, and hence began my exploration.

The road got narrower and the turns got sharper but there was less change in my speed. The first few miles were easy as I was driving down the hill. As it was past midnight other vehicles were seldom met and thus I started using both sides of the road. It helped in speeding through the curves and getting the adrenaline rush used. The road was not well maintained and I almost skidded through the gravel sometimes but it was all intended. Finally I reached my destination which was a sleeping town. I parked my bike near the post office and started walking. The night was so quite, I could hear the wind playing with the dry leaves. As I lied down and looked at the stars, I started thinking and got overwhelmed with memories. I stayed there for 30 min, took a picture for my XCD collection and kick started my return.

The battery of my phone was running out so I could no longer play the songs. I was more relaxed while coming back and took halts to absorb the view. One of these stops was just 3 miles from <a class="zem_slink" title="Sadhupul" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhupul" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Sadhupul</a> where I noticed the Himalayan <a class="zem_slink" title="Prayer flag" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_flag" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">prayer flags</a> tied across the trees. I often wonder what it could be that inspire the people to make these flags, climb up the tree and hang them with the rope. These flags were not put there for decoration, they carried wishes and blessings. I have always been mesmerized by them and thus continued my self-talk.

There were instances when I reached crossroads and had to search for a sign. Most of the times I just trusted my intuition as it anyways didn&#8217;t matter where I reached. I noticed later that I had used a longer route to Chail as I could take a turn from <a class="zem_slink" title="Solan district" href="http://hpsolan.nic.in/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Solan</a> instead of <a title="Wikipedia article" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandaghat" target="_blank">Kandaghat</a>. The purpose of this ride was to get one with myself, to be alone and to spend some time with ME.

_P.S.: I hope I&#8217;ll be able to follow my heart and trust my intuition when I face more crossroads in life._
