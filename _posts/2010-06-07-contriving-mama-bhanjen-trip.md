Contriving a trip is quite a difficult task. I got familiar with this fact after I was asked to plan a trip by my younger brother.

One thing was final that me and my cousin brother will go to Agra on my bike(XCD 125) and meet our nephews over there. I started with searching tourist places in Agra. And here is what I got:

_**Taj Mahal**
  
Taj Mahal, Agra TourismAgra is famous as being home to one of the seven wonders of the world- the Taj-Mahal. The architectural splendour of the mausoleums, the fort and the palaces is a vivid remainder of the mausoleums, the fort and the palaces is a vivid reminder of the capital in the 16th and early 17th centuries.
  
**Agra Fort**_ _
  
Red Fort, Agra TravelBuilt by the great Emperor Akbar in 1565 A.D. the fort Is a masterpiece of design and construction. Within the fort are a number of exquisite buildings, including the Moti Masjid, Diwane-E-Am, Diwani-E-Khaas and Musanman Burj, where the Emperor Shah Jahan died in imprisonment beside Jahangirs place, Khaas Mahal and the Sheesh Mahal.
  
**Itmad &#8211; Ud &#8211; Daula**_ _
  
Itmad-Ud-Daula, Agra Travels & ToursTo the north of the fort and across the river yamuna are several fine examples of mughal architecture. The itmad -ud -daula was build by the empress Noor Jehan as a memorial to her father Mirza Ghiyas Beg, is beautifully ornamented with pietra dura inlay and lattice work marble screens.
  
**Chini Ka Rauza**_ _
  
Chini Ka Rauza, Agra TourismThe tomb of Afzal khan, the persian poet and minister at Shah Jehan&#8217;s court gets its name from the brightly coloured glazed tiles that decorate it, lies just 1km beyond itmad-ud-daula.
  
**Sikandra Fort**_ _
  
Sikandra Fort, Agra Travel12km the tomb of Akbar, begun by the emperor himself and completed by his son, Jehangir. This richly decorated structure is a quaint mixture of styles.
  
Radhaswamy Satsang, Dayalbagh
  
This highly ornate memorial to the founder of the Radhaswamy satsang has been in the making for several years and is still being worked upon. It is entirely in marble, upon which every manner of ornamentation has been applied.
  
**Sur Sarovar**_ _
  
Sur Sarovar is a picturesque lake located about 23 km away from Agra, in Uttar Pradesh. Also known as the &#8220;Keetham Lake&#8221;, this astounding water body has always been a favorite haunt for group picnickers and nature lovers. Its serene beauty is said to have had influenced the poetic imagination of the great Sur Das. Sur Sarovar falls under the Sur Das Reserved Forest and was declared as a National Bird Sanctuary in 1991. More than 100 species of migratory and native birds are found in this 7.13 sq km of tranquil paradise. Major bird species found here are gadwals and shovellers, bar-headed geese, brahminy ducks, sarus cranes, Siberian cranes and spoonbills. It is also home to more than 18 species of reptiles and 12 species of mammals.
  
**Fatehpur Sikri**_ _
  
South-west of Agra is the deserted imperial city Fatehpur Sikri, one of India&#8217;s most alluring and breathtaking monuments. Built by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, this royal city is one of a kind. Every building, pavement, and courtyard in the complex is completely covered in red sandstone. It has a wonderful sense of space and freedom; a perfect combination of intricate workmanship and architecture on a monumental scale. The city of Fatehpur Sikri is a complicated complex of palaces and courtyards, full of light and air, unlike any of the palaces of Europe where the climate necessitated closed cloisters._

After reading all this, I realized that visiting these places isn&#8217;t gonna be enough. As I am more of a traveler than a tourist, I thought that we shall go for a longer run. While I googled for the nearest hill station to Agra, I came across Dehradun. It was possible that my nephews take a bike and the four of us leave for **Dehradun from Agra(381 km).**

**Proposed Time line:**

**Note:** _This is just an approximate idea. The actual schedule may vary according to the situation._

**Necessary goods:**

Driving License, Vehicle documents(pollution check, insurance, RC), First aid kit, Torch, Match box, Extra Towel, Water bottle

**A few tips:**

Stay hydrated, have plenty of cool water at hand.

Wear helmet, sun will bake your head like a cake if you don&#8217;t keep it covered.

Cooling neck rap, soak a towel in water and wring it out. It will keep your neck and cool for hours.

Lastly carry some snacks, sweet and salty ones. These kinds of snacks will give you energy and cause you to get thirsty. Getting thirsty will help to remind you to stay hydrated.

**The path to be followed:**

But this trip seems to be too long for others. I am just hoping that they get permissions from their parents or they come up with a better idea.
