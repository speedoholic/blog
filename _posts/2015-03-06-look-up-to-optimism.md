Have you ever tried looking up at the sky when you are feeling low?

Well, I used to go to my roof at night, lay down and look at the stars as I thought about my life and its complexities. Quite often, these serious discussions with myself would start with a pessimistic approach and all my problems would get stated one by one. As I tried to establish the fact that my life is miserable, I soon reached a point where there was no hope left and I would simply start cursing. And just when I was done with the reiteration of all my failures, I would realize that its a waste of time and energy to think about things that have either ended badly or are anyways going to end badly. In a few moments I would start dis-regarding my problems. It started with the most significant ones. The problems that could make me lose my mind during the day were now being pushed aside as I decided not to care. This process continued till I learned that in fact all my problems could be shrugged off, if I chose to.

Now was the time for my optimism to check in. Since I had already gotten rid of my problems, all I could think of was present; since present was the only time period which I had control over. My mind which was earlier full of destructive thoughts started thinking about creation. I was now in the _cool dude_ zone. I simply wanted to enjoy my life and live it to the fullest. Thus, I decided to to call up my friends and plan a night out.

Now that I think of it, these night outs were never actually planned well. Since most of the times we would either end up on a highway with no petrol or one of us would get hurt. Nevertheless these incidents were always enjoyable and rather created memories which helped me move from the pessimist to the optimist zone. After a few hours of drive on the highway, having sweet tea at truck stops served with regular leg-pulling and fresh PJs; life simply got a new beginning. And the next time I looked up at the sky, I could admire the beautiful stars while not thinking about the darkness.

As juvenile as this narration may seem, such instances had a huge impact on me, my way of thinking and my way of life.

This post has been inspired from the Look up stories happy hours contest by Indiblogger. Though the idea of writing an inspiring story from my life in itself was intriguing, I wanted to first have a look at the website to which I will be sharing a link to. Even though I have worked on various websites based on similar looking bootstrap templates, I have to admit that the photographs and color schemes used to create the theme were attention grabbing. If you are looking for inspiration or simply want to browse through a good looking website, check out <a title="housing.com" href="https://housing.com/lookup" target="_blank">https://housing.com/lookup</a>
