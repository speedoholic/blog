 ![](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/090111_1116_manageallyo1.png)Intel Appup Center offers a great deal of applications varying from education to games. When I browsed for my favourite App my eyes got fixed at Tweetdeck.

It is a [Twitter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter"), Facebook, MySpace, Google Buzz, Foursquare and LinkedIn client, which has been popular since 2009.

Although there are many applications that may offer similar integrations with these networks, there are certain features that make Tweetdeck stand alone.

The most important thing to be considered is that Tweetdeck has recently been acquired by twitter (May 25 2011) which makes it more authentic and proves to be good enough.

Some of the main facilities available are:

**Multiple columns**: One can organize the information into real-time columns which may include updates from friends, Facebook notifications, tweets from certain groups, etc. This provides the very recent updates organized as per the user&#8217;s interest.

**Multiple twitter accounts**: Some users like to keep up more than one twitter accounts. Like if you want to post tweets related to a certain topic from a different profile. Tweetdeck allows you to do so, and you can swap between the profiles with a single click.

**Reply, retweet, direct message and favorite from a tweet**: There are small buttons for these, which appear on the concerned image as one hovers on it. This makes it pretty fast and easy.

**View user profiles**: There is no need to open a separate web page as one can view the profiles in tweetdeck itself which will give all the required options like Follow, See recent updates and who a person is following and being followed by, etc

**Follow or unfollow and block or unblock a user**: This can be done very easily and saves time.

**Add All Friends, Mentions and DM columns**: These are some of the columns that may help you to deal with different activities of twitter simultaneously. This allows you to keep track in real-time.

**Add Search columns:** This is another important feature that allows you to add a separate column featuring the results of your search. (Very useful for dealing with hashtags)

**Add Trending Topic columns**: These columns connect you with the world in a single go.

**Add Twitter list columns**: You can organize various lists and keep track of them so.

**Cross post updates to any combination of your accounts**: This is my favourite feature as it allows you to decide which of the accounts you want to use for posting your updates.

**Geotag your tweets**: Just set your location once and your tweets can be geotagged automatically.

**Shorten URLs**: This makes sharing links fairly easy. It also allows you to choose the shortening service on your own.

**Access your Twitter contact list**: You can browse among the contacts and can search for a friend.

**Upload photos (from the on-board Photo Library)**: Sharing photos is of course one of the most required feature which is being covered.

**Rearrange columns however you like and delete those you no longer need**: Thus, you can always change your mind and try experimenting.

**View geocoded tweets on a full-screen map**: This feature allows you to see where the tweets are coming from.

And this is not the end of it, the development status of this application is active and there are likely to be even more magical updates to it. Some of them can be listed as:

**Quick Send tweet**: Suppose you notice a tweet which seems interesting but you don&#8217;t have enough time to explore. This feature will allow you to directly email it for later consideration.

**Gmail Notifications:** These when integrated with tweetdeck will allow you to keep track of your emails as well.

**Unicode Art**: This will allow you to use smiley faces, arrows, etc.

**Tweet as you go**: This can truly be a fresh design that will allow the users to use the camera in their portable device to see where they are going while using tweetdeck. Hence you don&#8217;t have to worry about crashing into a pole while you were busy typing your tweet while walking.
  
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

Thus, I can say that tweetdeck is the best application I have ever used for dealing with my twitter account. And if you are into facebook, you will notice that reading updates and responding to them is a lot easier and faster.

The environment that allows Tweetdeck to take care of all the above mentioned characteristics is called Adobe Integrated Runtime. This cross-platform runtime environment is abbreviated as **Adobe AIR** which might be already installed on your computer as it comes along various installations of Adobe like Adobe Reader 9, Photoshop and Lightroom with no option for exclusion.

**Support**: Tweetdeck is supported by operating systems like **Windows, Linux, Apple iOS and Android** as well. Thus you can use it anywhere anytime. Several different versions have been launched which allow you to decide how you want to use it. There is a downloadable desktop version that allows you to use it just like any other application installed. Other versions include **iPhone, iPad, Android, Chrome and Web**(limited beta). Each of these has been carefully designed keeping in mind the needs and platform being used.

As most of us are on facebook, even if you are not a fan of twitter or other networks specified, you can try this application for the sake of most popular social network (facebook as for now) at least. I would suggest that one should sign-up for twitter and try using this application after connecting the account, and I am pretty sure that even the least active person on twitter will start enjoying it.
