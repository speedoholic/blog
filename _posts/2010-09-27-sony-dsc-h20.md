[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-410" title="sony-dsc-h20" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/sony-dsc-h20.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="220" />](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/sony-dsc-h20.jpg)The **<a class="zem_slink" title="Cyber-shot" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-shot">Sony Cybershot</a> H series DSC-H20 (Rs.17,316)** comprises all that is needed by an average photographer. This camera assures great quality <a class="zem_slink" title="Photograph" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph">photographs</a> even if you are not a professional. There are so many options which can be easily selected by the user.

**Pros:**

  * Various shooting modes (Advanced Sports Shooting, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Soft Snap, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, High Sensitivity, Gourme)
  * Small size (easy to handle)
  * User friendly (less buttons but more features)
  * Smile detector (Sony always add such flashy features to stand above the crowd)
  * Big display (the 3 inch <a class="zem_slink" title="Liquid crystal display" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display">LCD</a> makes you enjoy viewing the slide-show with music)
  * Easy photo editing (One can edit it in the camera itself and use effects like Vivid, Sepia, B&W )

  * Not so good-looking (This camera neither looks like some flashy gadget nor does it appear as a professional camera)
  * Some people prefer to buy a <a class="zem_slink" title="Digital single-lens reflex camera" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera">DSLR</a> by spending a little more than this.
