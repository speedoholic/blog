<p style="text-align:left;">
  One thing that I don&#8217;t like about using WordPress is that most of my friends are on blogger and it&#8217;s kinda pain to manage both. So today when I made some comments on the blog posts by my friends, I decided to post them here as well.
</p>

I am writing this post just as a log because these are my good friends and I like to keep good memories.

  1. The first one is by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/armaan.goyal" target="_blank">Armaan</a>, who thinks about love at &#8220;3 am&#8221;; no wonder he comes late to college.
  2. The second is by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000360504764" target="_blank">Niharika</a>, who wants to say that money is not everything and one shall give more importance to happiness. Well her smiling face and gracious nature can sure change ones mood, so I hope she stays happy and make others happy.
  3. And the third one is by <a style="text-align:left;" href="https://www.facebook.com/manik.msh" target="_blank">Mr. Manik (SS)</a>; who has nothing important to share right now. Just suffering from cold and making people imagine what is happening inside his nose and God knows what other places.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-align:left;">Just click on the titles below, and new tabs/windows will open in your browser(depending on your browser settings of course) where you can read the corresponding posts.</span><br style="text-align:left;" /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-align:left;">Â </span>

### <a title="Blog post" href="http://armaan-goyal.blogspot.com/2011/11/thot-at-3-am_14.html" target="_blank">A thot at 3 am<br /> </a><a href="http://armaan-goyal.blogspot.com/2011/11/thot-at-3-am_14.html" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-989" title="arman" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/arman.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="404" /></a>

Wow! such painful thoughts!
  
I wish your love understands you soon.

But don&#8217;t you think, even after people get their love, it&#8217;s not &#8220;ALL GooD&#8221;?

There are many more problems.

At this moment, you only have memories and your own feelings, but once the feelings get mutual, the probable pain also get&#8217;s two-fold.
  
That pain can be even worse.

It&#8217;s one thing to know that your love is not with you, and another to know that even though it&#8217;s with you, things are not good.

well enough pessimism for today, but it&#8217;s just the way life is. (Mostly)

and BTW.. NiceÂ Hindi!

Money gives us pleasure, security and confidence.

People with bad economic conditions might be forcing a smile on their faces, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they are happy.
  
Especially not because they don&#8217;t care about money. They do care, but they just can&#8217;t do anything about it.

The one who has enormous money is the only one who can think that he doesn&#8217;t want money. When you are living without food, shelter and clothes, you can&#8217;t even dream about being happy.

At one point or the other, it becomes our foremost need.

Read the novel by <a class="zem_slink" title="Jack London" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London" rel="wikipedia">Jack London</a> &#8220;<a title="The People of theÂ Abyss" href="http://kushalashok.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/the-people-of-the-abyss/" target="_blank">People of the Abyss</a>&#8221; and you will know, how a material created by humans(money), makes them suffer.
