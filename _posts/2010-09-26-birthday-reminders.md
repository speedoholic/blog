We all are busy with our lives and don&#8217;t have time to celebrate. This lack of enthusiasm often leads us to forget important days like birthdays. When one forgets his own birthday, he is assumed to be depressed and people pity him. On the other hand, when one forgets his friend&#8217;s or family member&#8217;s birthday, he faces anger and shame. Although it is practically very difficult to remember all the birthdays, most of us get reminded of them by other friends. However, there are instances when no-one is there to remind you. And you may face situations like the one depicted in the following image:

This article is about some of the methods, which shall be used to avoid all this confusion.

**1)****Set email reminders**:

One of the best way to get reminded online is by registering yourselves at websites like &#8220;birthdaycalendars.ca&#8221; _(find the link at end of the article)_ and following these steps:

  * Log-in at birthdaycalendars.ca
  * Click on the link &#8220;My birthday <a class="zem_slink" title="Calendar" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar">calendar</a>&#8220;
  * Enter the names beside the corresponding dates
  * Click on the button &#8220;Click here to save and update your birthday calendar&#8221;

Once you do this, you get notified via email (sent to the address you entered during registration), about the birthdays.

**Pros:** One can enter up to 100 characters for each date, so you can put reminders not only for birthdays, but other things as well

**Cons:** There is no option to set the time of email delivery. The message gets delivered at 1am <a class="zem_slink" title="Pacific Time Zone" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone">Pacific Time</a>(US & <a class="zem_slink" title="Canada" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.4,-75.6666666667&spn=10.0,10.0&q=45.4,-75.6666666667%20%28Canada%29&t=h">Canada</a>) on the day before your reminder.

**2)Set reminders in Mobile Calendar**:

This is the most common method which is already being used by many people. Setting reminders in your <a class="zem_slink" title="Mobile phone" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone">mobile phone</a> is most easy and worthy as well. Most of the mobile phones comes with a calendar, one can enter the birthday reminders and get notified at whatever time he wants.

**3)Book <a class="zem_slink" title="Text messaging" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging">text message</a> for the Birthday Boy/Girl**

There are websites like <a class="zem_slink" title="Way2SMS.com" rel="homepage" href="http://www.way2sms.com">way2sms.com</a> (very useful for Indian customers), where you can sign-up and set future text messages, which are delivered directly to the Birthday boy/girl at the desired time and date. However the website mentioned here allows one to set up the text messages for the next five days only.

  * Log-in at way2sms.com
  * Click on the &#8220;future sms&#8221; tab
  * Enter the Mobile number (10 digits only)
  * Enter the message to be delivered (one can also use the templates available at the &#8220;quick sms&#8221; tab)
  * Enter the desired date and time for delivery

After doing this, you don&#8217;t even have to worry about sending a text message. It can also happen that the person texts or call you back (as your mobile number will be displayed with the text you sent) and thank you for the wishes, so always be ready to pretend that you sent that message. I hope one can at least remember this much that he/she had set up a future message.

_So, once you do all this, you can be pretty sure that you won&#8217;t be blamed for forgetting a birthday in future. And last but not the least, these reminders can also help you buy gifts or plan surprise parties for your loved ones._
