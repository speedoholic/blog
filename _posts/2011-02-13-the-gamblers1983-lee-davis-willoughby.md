I have read novels which mostly used layman&#8217;s language and I didn&#8217;t feel like opening dictionary now and then, but when I started reading this novel by <a href="http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/w/lee-davis-willoughby/" target="_blank">Lee Davis Willoughby</a> I was stunned by the first-class use of words. There were times when I almost felt like I was at some unexampled land. The characters were very well portrayed and the flow of story was quite suave!

Although there were times when I kind of lost the interest because of the redundant explanation of events which were not holding much importance in the story.

P.S.: It was a nice novel which acquainted me with a new genre!

**My rating: 7/10**
