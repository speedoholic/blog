Magnet U &#8211; A **Social Proximity Gadget**

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <strong><a href="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/magnetu.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1008 aligncenter" title="magnetU" alt="" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/magnetu.png" height="62" width="177" /></a></strong>

**Introduction**

<a class="zem_slink" title="Wireless" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless" rel="wikipedia">Wireless communication</a> is most widely used by the mobile devices in today’s scenario. But a <a class="zem_slink" title="Mobile phone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone" rel="wikipedia">mobile phone</a> only allows us to connect with the people we already know or have some details about. Also, in the case of smart phones, one can access the <a class="zem_slink" title="List of social networking websites" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites" rel="wikipedia">social networking websites</a> but that doesn’t help us know about the real people that might be sitting around us.

It has often been said that the <a class="zem_slink" title="Social network service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service" rel="wikipedia">online social networking</a> is killing the real social life of the people. But this won’t be a problem if the online world and real world are merged into each other.

Now, it is possible to take online social networking into the real world, **MagnetU** bridges the online and the physical.

**World&#8217;s first wearable social accessory
  
<img class="aligncenter" title="Magnet U" alt="" src="http://6.mshcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/User-holding-magnetU-in-hand_image.jpg" height="286" width="640" />
  
** Connecting users with people they like, and with the businesses they frequent, magnetU is the world&#8217;s first wearable social accessory that lets people wear their social desires, allowing immediate social gratification anywhere, anytime.

**Dynamic <a class="zem_slink" title="Social network" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network" rel="wikipedia">social networks</a> of proximity**

MagnetU creates dynamic social networks of proximity between people in the real world. Through a fun concept of &#8220;Attractive&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Hot&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Red Hot&#8221; social match messages, or simply by &#8220;cheers&#8221; your magnetU with others, magnetU connects users with mutually matched social desires when they are in the same place or in a network of proximity of potentially hundreds of meters. It&#8217;s fun and valuable &#8211; you can be in the magnetU network whether you are indoor or outdoor, it can work anywhere. magnetU also bridges loyalty programs and physical advertising with online social networking. There&#8217;s a whole range of apps for one’s social desires: socializing, social business card exchange, dating, business matches &#8211; and more to come.

**Connected by a Virtual network cable**

MagnetU brings together social networking, mobile telephony and proximity technology, creating the first ever, patent-pending, dynamic mobile network of proximity. It builds dynamic mobile human networks with the people around you &#8211; as they walk or stand, anywhere &#8211; indoor or outdoor, without even knowing of your actual location! The magnetU network grows organically as users go about their daily activities. People are moving, running, walking and magnetU uses this mobile dynamic environment like they are all connected through a &#8220;network cable&#8221;.

** ****MagnetU Profiles**

For magnetU, every profile that users wear is actually an application. For example, a profile form that is focused on socializing is used for social applications, a business matches profile is used by business people, and so on. One won&#8217;t need to actually develop an application, but a profile form. One can develop different types of profiles, which are themselves applications. The profiles can then be put on our profile applications store, and downloaded by magnetU users.

**How it works?**

MagnetU is a tiny device that travels along with you and seeks out other MagnetU users. If two social profiles are a good fit, it will notify users of each other&#8217;s proximity.

Here&#8217;s how it works. Load up the MagnetU application, create a set of &#8220;social desires,&#8221; and hook it up with Facebook and Twitter. The gadget connects with your phone using Bluetooth.

When social desires mesh, you get a message on your phone that ranks the match as &#8220;attractive,&#8221; &#8220;hot,&#8221; or &#8220;red-hot.&#8221;

Clinking two MagnetU devices together links up your social profiles so you can stay connected with your new BFF after you&#8217;ve parted ways.

This sounds like a natural fit for the club and dating scene, but it could also come into play as a business-networking tool for large conferences or events.

**Changing profiles**

Users can change the profiles they broadcast, or their “social desires,” depending on the situation. You might use a “social” profile that describes your ideal date when you’re out to a bar and a “business” profile that describes your ideal business partner when you’re at a conference. Brands can develop a social desires profile too. A concert venue might, for instance, develop a profile that connects users with similar music tastes.

**What is expected?**

Instead of setting your gaze permanently at nametag level during conferences, you’d receive a text message when someone with a relevant business opportunity enters the room. And at a concert, you’d know who shares your taste in music without borrowing their <a class="zem_slink" title="IPod" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod" rel="wikipedia">iPods</a>.

**Privacy settings****
  
** When two devices make a mutually satisfying match, they alert their owners via SMS message or mobile app, ranking the strength of the match and delivering whatever contact information the device owners have allowed in their privacy settings.

**Exchange of Information
  
[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009" title="magnetuclink_1_610x441" alt="" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/magnetuclink_1_610x441.jpg" height="361" width="500" />](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/magnetuclink_1_610x441.jpg)**
  
MagnetU also provides Bump-like exchanges of contact information. When users press a “cheers” button and knock their devices together, they automatically send each other friend requests on all of their social networks, in addition to any contact information they’ve listed in their profiles.

**Low Cost**

A MagnetU device costs only $24. Given its low cost and the attractive features, it has a very good possibility of becoming popular. Everyone around you will be walking around with a MagnetU in their pockets.

** ****Better than <a class="zem_slink" title="Global Positioning System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" rel="wikipedia">GPS</a>, Foursquare and other social networks**

GPS doesn’t work indoors, drains your mobile battery and impedes on your privacy by making your physical location known.

It can also be considered better than <a class="zem_slink" title="Foursquare" href="http://www.foursquare.com/" rel="homepage">Foursquare.</a> From a marketing perspective, this would be like a version of Foursquare that doesn’t require a checkin. From a social perspective, however, it’s a very different thing than Foursquare. Instead of being an extension to offline connections, it creates them.

The device will contain all your social network profiles including Facebook, Twitter, <a class="zem_slink" title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com" rel="homepage">LinkedIn</a> and others.

**Drawback**
  
As one need to use a device separate from the smartphone, MagnetU&#8217;s success hinges on enough people adopting it.

** **

**Conclusion:**
  
“It isn’t telling you where your friends are; it’s actually making new connections with new people.”
