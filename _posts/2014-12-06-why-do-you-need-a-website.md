This is the question that many of us have asked ourselves several times, **&#8220;Why do I need a website?&#8221;**; and the answer becomes quite obvious after reading this post.

# **Individual**

If you think that you don&#8217;t need a website because you are just another employee, you are wrong! You are special, and you need a special website that reflects your profession and personality. It is obvious that you are going to change your job sooner or later and thus having your portfolio on your website is going to help you during those phases. But this does not mean that you should have a website only when you are looking for a new job. A website takes time and efforts to make it credible and if you want it to be counted as one of your achievements, you definitely need to work on it in advance.

You need a website, irrespective of your profession. But some of the professions have more use of a website than the others. For example, a web developer who doesn&#8217;t have his own website is simply wasting his chance to showcase his skills. Same is true for web designers and other related professions. On the other hand, if you are in any profession that deals with anything that can be put on a screen, you need to have a website.

As for prerequisites, I would suggest that every graduate should have a personal website. A good place to start would be <a title="Kushal's about me profile" href="http://about.me/kushalashok" target="_blank">about.me</a>. Consolidating all your public profiles on a single page will allow your visitors to learn more about you via different platforms. Following are a few examples:

  <a title="My personal website" href="http://kushalashok.com" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-1631 size-large" src="http://34.229.211.245/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/kushalashok-1024x575.png" alt="myWebsite" width="460" height="258" /></a>

  Business
</h1>

If you are a businessmen, having a website is even more important for you and your business. There can be two kinds of businesses. Ones that can sell their services or products online and ones that can not. With the advent of technology, the percentage of businesses lying in the second category has become very less. Today, you can buy anything online; from a safety pin to a private jet.

Even if your business provides services or goods that can not be sold online, you still need to have a website to create your brand&#8217;s identity, to provide a platform where your customers can reach you, to impress them enough so they can visit your store or office; with confidence. Most importantly, having a website will make sure that you have a credible online presence. For example, there are millions of businesses listed on websites like justdial.com. From a customer&#8217;s point of view, your business is just another listing until it is connected with a website. This website in turn will showcase your work and let your customers determine, how good you are.

Now let&#8217;s talk about **businesses that manufacture or market products**. With the increasing popularity of e-commerce, it is very likely that you will be selling your products on websites like flipkart and snapdeal. Let us spend us time on understanding why you will be doing so.
  
No matter how much money you put into the marketing your products, you can not compete with the prices offered on these websites. This is because they are being funded by Wall street. Big investors like DST global and Soft Bank Corp. have been funneling billions of dollars into India&#8217;s consumer internet story. In 2014, Indian e-commerce websites raised around 3 billion dollars. These online players are likely to spend around 6000 crore rupees on discounting and  marketing in 2015.

**Case-study**: During Diwali promotions in 2014, <a title="Flipkart" href="http://flipkart.com" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>, <a title="snapdeal" href="http://snapdeal.com" target="_blank">Snapdeal</a> and Seattle based giant <a title="amazon" href="http://amazon.in" target="_blank">Amazon</a> had consumed around half a billion dollars for giving discounts, cash back and flat out sales. Also, they have spent around 1200 crore rupees on advertising via different means including social media, television and newspapers.

By now you must have understood, why it is important for businesses to list their products on these websites. Again, the consumers will have a lot of options while making a purchase and the only way you can make a difference is by having your own presentable website. Have a look at this website created for Ashuraj Plastic Industries:

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1632" src="http://34.229.211.245/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ashurajIndustries-1024x575.png" alt="Ashuraj Plastic Industries Website" width="460" height="258" />](http://ashuplastics.in)

# Government and non-profit

This is not just true for private businesses, even government has started moving in this direction. One recent example I can quote, is that of Himachal Pradesh State Agricultural Marketing Board. They have now created a website for marketers and farmers dealing with apples and other produces of Himachal Pradesh. This has brought them one step forward as they can now easily brand their produces in national as well as international markets.
  
The state has been known for it&#8217;s production of apples which are being exported to various countries. Apples in fact play a very important role in Himachal&#8217;s economy. 9 out of 12 districts produce apple and apple economy is pegged around rupees 2500 crore. The area under apple cultivation has increased from 400 hectares in 1950 to more than 1 lakh hectares today.

The goal of this website is not just branding, but also to make sure that farmers can get rid of the middlemen system. They would not be required to travel outside to sell their produce anymore. Everything can be done online as CCTV cameras are being installed to provide live streaming on the website.

Other than the government, non-profit organizations have also utilized internet in various ways. Collecting funds is very important for any such organization which is only possible by having an effective online presence. Other than social media which allows any one to create a profile and page, having a website makes these organizations more reliable. Mostly, a simple 5 page website is enough to create an impression:

There is always a scope of improvement when you move your business online. Around <span class="rts-nr-int rts-nr-10e9">3</span><span class="rts-nr-thsep">,</span><span class="rts-nr-int rts-nr-10e6">027</span><span class="rts-nr-thsep">,217,800 people were online when I was writing this post. As for India, around 243,198,922 people have access to internet which are increasing by 14 percent each year. And with this, I rest my case.</span>
