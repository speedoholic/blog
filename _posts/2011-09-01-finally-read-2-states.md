I have been trying to read this fourth novel of the renowned writer &#8216;**_Chetan Bhagat&#8217;_** and finally got the chance when I borrowed it from a friend.

**Review:  
**   
I enjoyed reading this novel as there were many things that I could relate to. Moreover, almost all the punch lines worked for me. Chetan managed to bring out laughter even out of most awkward situations and the continuity of jokes polished the story. The college environment could be pictured well which has been done in his previous novels as well. Sarcasm and wittiness are also given a proper account. Nature and culture of Punjabis and South Indians have been depicted substantially. 

P.S.: The moral is also commendable: **&#8220;Differences need to be dealt with&#8221;**
