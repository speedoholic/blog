This novel can make you think about relations and the concerned can of worms. Even though it could not keep me spell-bound I liked the language and some peculiar phrases. The incidents were explained gratingly and indeed there were moments when I could picture the abrasiveness. The scenes keep jumping from one time frame to another but it had no effect on the understanding and impact of the story. 

This is a very intelligent novel that can make you introspect a lot. Catastrophically I would not suggest this novel to people who read merely for entertainment.
