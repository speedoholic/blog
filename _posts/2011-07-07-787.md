Now even social networking seems to be behaving like fashion Industry. 

What goes now may come back again and when it does, they can still make a fuss about it; like it&#8217;s brand new!! 

[Myspace released skype-powered calls in 2007](http://mashable.com/2011/07/06/myspace-skype-partnership-2/) and today the same thing gets launched by facebook with a lot more bickering. 

Also the concept of circles as for maintaining friend-lists was being used by Hi5 already, which can now be seen with Google-Plus.

_P.S.: Life is like a boomerang that hits you pretty hard if you don&#8217;t remember when is it gonna come back!
