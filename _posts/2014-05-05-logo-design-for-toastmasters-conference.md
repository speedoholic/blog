<img src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/resonce_logo.png" class="size-full" alt="Logo design for Toastmasters Conference" />

This logo was created when I got contacted by Division C Governer of District 41 Toastmasters International (Sunil Nair) for designing a logo for the semi annual conference 2014. The keyword to be used was &#8220;Resonance&#8221; and the tag line was mentioned as &#8220;Empower, Enrich, Evolve&#8221;. It was built using Adobe Photoshop.
