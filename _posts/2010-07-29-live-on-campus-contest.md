I came across _Live On Campus(LOC)_ at [facebook](http://facebook.com) and decided to take part in the **campus clix** contest. The advertisement of the contest went like this:

_Share your favorite campus moments with everyone and win cool prizes. All you have to do is simply post a photo on the LOC wall, tag your friends in the photo (if any) and share it with your friends to earn points. The more likes and comments your photos get the more points you make!_ 

I uploaded a photograph of my friends playing cards in the class room which I took using my Sony H20 a long time ago.

I realized that I have to ask people to comment on this photograph, but it required a procedure which was longer than I thought, so I made 2 short links using <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="http://my.dot.tk/cgi-bin/amb/landing.dottk?nr=259371::7434005::1" target="_new"><br /> <span style="color:#00f;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Free Domain name service</span></span></a>
  
and used the following text to make people comment on it:

**me:** Hello! May I ask for a favor?

**friend:** Ya sure! what is it?

**me:**
