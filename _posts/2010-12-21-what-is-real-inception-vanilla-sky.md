**Note: This may contain spoilers!**

I have watched 2 movies today, one being &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Vanilla Sky" rel="anyclip" href="http://anyclip.com/vanilla-sky">Vanilla Sky</a>&#8221; and the other &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Inception" rel="anyclip" href="http://anyclip.com/inception">Inception</a>&#8220;. Both of them were based on the concept of dreams. The person living the dream confuses it with reality. At the end, it comes out that all that has been happening was just a dream. Both of them made me think hard and I have to admit that both were having a very effective theme.

**[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-509" title="vanilla sky" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/vanilla-sky.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="260" />](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/vanilla-sky.jpg)Vanilla Sky** revolves around a man who goes through an accident (which disfigures his face) and opts for an option called <a class="zem_slink" title="Lucid dream" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream">Lucid Dream</a>, because of which his body is preserved at very low temperature while he continues to dream and live what he wanted. Eventually it came out to be a nightmare as he confuses the two women in his life, the one he shared bed with who was responsible for the accident and the one he truly loved. He was finally given an option to choose between a dream better than this one or go back to reality. After having a last moment with his love he decides to choose reality.

**Inception** is about a man who along with his friends specializes in entering people&#8217;s dream and get useful information from their minds. He ends up helping  a person to plant an idea in someone&#8217;s mind, in return for a favor that will allow him to go back home and meet his children. While it was the first inception for rest of the team, he had done it before to his wife who ended up dying because of that idea only. His guilt made him go back to her every time he was in a dream. The team has to go deeper and deeper in order to fulfill their task, that is they were suppose to enter a dream inside another dream up to 4 levels. The movie ends with success of the team and he returning to his home but what develops curiosity is that he is still inside a dream.

_P.S. : These movies made me feel dizzy!_
