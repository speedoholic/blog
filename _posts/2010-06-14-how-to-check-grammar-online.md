  <p>
    It happens to us all the time that while <a class="zem_slink" title="Typing" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing">typing</a> an email or blog we get confused and don&#8217;t understand what to write next and soon start doubting the sentences we have written.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are a wordpress blogger, you can use the <a class="zem_slink" title="Grammar checker" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar_checker">grammar check</a> facility which tells you about all the mistakes when you try to publish your post. You can validate this by visiting the user settings section available at your dashboard.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Note that this facility is available only for the users of wordpress.com and not for the <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" rel="homepage" href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a> users. <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress.com" rel="homepage" href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> is very much different from wordpress.org. Like, the wordpress.com users get facilities like grammar check, tag suggestions, themes, widgets and most important one is the spam blocking facility.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    While on the other hand, wordpress.org users don&#8217;t get any of these facilities. However, they can use <a class="zem_slink" title="Plug-in (computing)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_%28computing%29">plug-ins</a> at their websites and are not restricted from posting adds.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Grammatical mistakes are very common while you are thinking and typing simultaneously. And most of the text editors don&#8217;t provide you with the facility of grammar check.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That is why I would suggest that one should use the grammar checking software which is available online for free. You just need to use this link: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.whitesmoke.com/free-online-checker" target="_new">http://www.whitesmoke.com/free-online-checker</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Following the above link is the best option to check your <a class="zem_slink" title="Grammar" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar">grammar</a> online.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Cons: </strong>This software allows you to check only limited amount of words for free. One can upgrade to a paid account to get rid of this constraint.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I hope this helps!
