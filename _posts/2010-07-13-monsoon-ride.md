It rained heavily today, the parking space got filled with <a class="zem_slink" title="Water" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water">water</a>, and I was supposed to move the bike outside. As I entered the water, dragging my feet towards my bike, I decided to go for a ride.  My neighbors watched me, driving away my <a class="zem_slink" title="Motorcycle" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle">motorcycle</a> in such a freakish weather. The electricity was cut off, water droplets were entering my eye, and I couldn&#8217;t see clearly. Still I managed to speed up on straight roads. I was listening to my favorite songs on my i-pod, which helped in pumping my adrenaline. Soon I started jumping my bike on the speed beakers. My bike skidded many times at the turns or whenever a fallen tree came in front of me. I covered almost all the lanes of my township and kept rushing my bike for about half an hour. Whenever I saw some stagnant water on the road, I accelerated the bike to splash as much water as I could.  This <a class="zem_slink" title="Monsoon" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon">monsoon</a> ride was awesome, and I enjoyed a lot.

And just like I always say, &#8220;**If you don&#8217;t ride in <a class="zem_slink" title="Rain" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain">rain</a>, you don&#8217;t ride!** &#8220;
