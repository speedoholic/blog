<a class="zem_slink" title="Jake Gyllenhaal" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> just stole the show this time. The movie is worth watching in a theater. Almost everything about the movie was good, casting, acting, story line, comedy, background etc.

The ostrich thing added a good humor to it. The direction is very good and one gets stitched to his seat while watching this movie.

&#8220;Its a good family movie&#8221;

If you haven&#8217;t watched it yet, you are missing a great deal.

What?
