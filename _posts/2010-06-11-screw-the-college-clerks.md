We all get screwed up when we have to deal with the college clerks. Every time we go there, we have to play &#8220;Office Office&#8221;

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-215" title="ofice" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/ofice.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="287" />](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/ofice.jpg)

Can&#8217;t say much about other trades.. but when I have to deal with the one allotted to CSE its always like:

**First day** 

One can never find the clerk on the first day of need itself

**The day I finally find him** 

Me: Sir I need these documents for my bank loan

Clerk: the fee structure isn&#8217;t finalized yet, come after a few days.

Me: Ok

**After a few days** 

Me: Sir, I need those documents

Clerk: I told you, the fee structure isn&#8217;t finalized

**After few more days I see the fee structure being displayed on the notice board. Clerk is absent for the whole week** 

**After few days when Clerk is back** 

Me: Can I have my documents, I saw that fee structure has been finalized now?

Clerk: Come back 2mrw between 2 to 3 pm!

**Next day** 

Me:My documents?

Clerk: I am very busy rytnw come back later

Me: But you said the same thing yesterday!

Clerk:I told you to come between 2 to 3pm!

Me: Yes, but I had a lecture to attend at that time

Clerk: I don&#8217;t have time for this rytnw

(Me whispering: a**hole)

**Next day** 

Clerk is not there, gone for lunch

**Next day** 

Room is locked

**Next day** 

Me: Sir i need those documents fast, finalz are going on and I would have to go home soon

Clerk: Give me the application, I&#8217;l see to it

**Next Day**

I see him walking away fast, don&#8217;t even want to stop him this time

**Next Day** 

Me: Sir have you got my documents?

ClerK: come at 3 pm

Me: I have to give my final exam at that time

Clerk: then come back some other day

**I finally call my Dad, he calls the main office!** 

**Next day(last semester exam, have to leave for home after the exam, Need the documents anyhow)** 

Me: My documents?

Clerk: Write another application and give it to me fast

**Application written and handed over** 

Clerk: Come after n hour

Me: I am having my exam, will you be here if I come after the exam?

Clerk: Come after 5min

**Coming back after 5 min I get the document signed by the Director.**

_**The work which could be done in 10mins took me a month to get it done from the Clerk**_
