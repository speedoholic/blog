And I am at my home, enjoying food made by my mom. I was sick of eating outside food.

Its around 1am and I am not feeling sleepy at all.[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-129" title="kushal and raicky" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/kushal-and-raicky.jpg?w=224" alt="" width="224" height="298" />](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/kushal-and-raicky.jpg) My old friends have come to delhi from their respective colleges. I came to know this when Raicky(Digvijay) called me in the evening. He had just reached his uncle&#8217;s house in Faridabad(Near Delhi). My other two friends(Amandeep and Ankur Khasa), went to pick him up from Delhi Airport.

We have planned to get together at connaught place today. But I don&#8217;t think my parents are gonna allow me to go there because they have some other plan for today as its Sunday. These situations get very difficult sometimes. Now I have to convince my parents anyhow. After all my best friends are here after about 4 months. Lets try.. (Best of luck to me)
