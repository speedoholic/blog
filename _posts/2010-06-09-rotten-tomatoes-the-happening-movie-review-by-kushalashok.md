I watched this movie yesterday.
  
Although the producer and director is an oscar nominee, but i have to say that this one wasnt as satisfactory as his previous films. The picturisation was excellent but i was unable to understand certain things about the film.
  
Like i am still unable to undersatand that what was it causing all those deaths.

And how could be a man tempted to kill himself by any possible measure.

Overall I cant give this movie a rating of 3 out of 5 stars.

They also tried to confuse with the heroin&#8217;s character, by showing her psycho behaviour and hatred towards her in Hero&#8217;s friend&#8217;s mind.

If anyone among you can describe these things to me.. I would liketo change my rating!!
