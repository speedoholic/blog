This post is dedicated to my friend Sachin Mittal whom I know for more than 7 years now. Our friendship began in college where we used to hang out together. We belonged to the same batch during first year and studied together during all our exams. Even today when I look at the pictures or videos that we shot, it brings a smile on my face. Laughing on each other&#8217;s poor jokes, playing the same prank again and again, enjoying the common sense of helplessness before an exam and then talking about the wrong answers after we came out of the exam room, all such memories are always there with me.

Since we belonged to different streams of engineering, we were allocated to separate batches in the second year of college. But we continued to go on short trips, which increased further as he moved to a room in the same building as of mine. We started sharing more and used to talk about our failures and aspirations. Other than the daily outing to the nearby market, we also went on a long trip to Kedarnath which started with a simple discussion we had on a Tuesday evening. Following is the narration as per my recollection:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Sachin: It&#8217;s Tuesday, Do you wanna go to the temple?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Kushal: I don&#8217;t think one should only go to temples on a Tuesday. But never mind, it has been almost an year since I went to one, so let&#8217;s go.
</p>

  <em>After paying a visit to the temple</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Kushal: You know what, I think I missed out on a few things by not visiting a temple during all these months. And this visit to the nearby temple did not make up for it. How about the Kedarnath Temple?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Sachin: I have been wanting to visit that temple since long. When do you want to visit?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Kushal: Tonight!
</p>

The next thing I knew, we were four guys with baggage on my Bajaj XCD driving as fast as we could, to catch the last bus to Haridwar. The whole trip was as adventurous as this beginning and we literally ran down the hills while coming back from the Kedarnath temple.

After college, though we got placed in the same company, I started my job a few months sooner since I belonged to the computer science stream and he was a mechanical engineer trying to fit into the same shoes. After almost an year we met again as he got the same allocation as mine. We continued the journey of our friendship together and he played a huge role in helping me meet my love. From recharging my phone to getting my bike repaired, this friend of mine did everything I ever asked of him. He has always been there when I needed him the most. He has been the source of my strength and optimism.

Today I am married and we still share the same trust and frankness which we had in college. I am lucky to have a friend like him and shall cherish this friendship forever.
