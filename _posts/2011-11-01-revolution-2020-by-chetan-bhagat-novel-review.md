[<img class="size-medium wp-image-923 alignleft" title="r2020" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/r2020.jpg?w=214" alt="Revolution 2020" width="214" height="300" />](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/r2020.jpg)I ordered this novel in spite of the negative reviews and by the time it got delivered, I was pretty upset about making a wrong choice. But as I was free coz of Diwali Holidays, it worked as a pass-time.

The start-off was fine with the infantile childhood memories, but the story was unable to take effective turns I guess. Although I did enjoy some of the lines (which I even tweeted while I was reading), there were not enough punches in this one.
  
One thing that I like the most about Mr. Chetan&#8217;s novel is that the humor is maintained even in the worst situations. For instance, in his last novel called [&#8220;2 states&#8221;](http://kushalashok.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/finally-read-2-states/ "Finally read 2 states"), there was reference to the weird underwear of the guy when he was worried about his marriage.

Anyhow, this post is about Revolution 2020 and I intend to keep it short, because it doesn&#8217;t have much to discuss about.
  
As for the story, it is quite simple and kind of predictable at most points. You can read the synopsis at: <http://www.chetanbhagat.com/books/revolution-2020/>

The prologue and epilogue were used in a very conventional style, with the whole novel being a narration of the guy who suffered the most. The character&#8217;s emotions were portrayed pretty well and his changing course of life and thoughts was the only curve.

Maybe this was just a try to make us understand the effects of corruption and a story telling that &#8220;money can&#8217;t buy you happiness&#8221;.
