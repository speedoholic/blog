DD news is a lot better than those faking channels. (no need to name a few, they all are equally GOOD)

Rather it&#8217;s the only Hindi news channel worth following.

Why?
  
Well you will never find the following headlines streaming for the whole day (and sometimes even more) at DD:

1)War between the Khans
  
-so what if he didn&#8217;t go to the party? Watch their movies, not their lives!

2) latest crisps about TV serials
  
-as if our lives are dependent on whether a character will get back from death or not.

3) movie trailers and talks
  
-excuse me! But is this MTV?

4) &#8220;jaya veeru ke beech jang!&#8221;
  
-cricket cricket and cricket!
  
haven&#8217;t you guys watched the latest ad? Change the game!!!
  
Well I know IPL is on, but these guys talk about useless stuff!
