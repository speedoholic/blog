  <em>Things that gained my interest</em>
</p>

Even before entering the “<a title="Pragati Maidan" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=28.616813,77.243359&spn=0.01,0.01&q=28.616813,77.243359 (Pragati%20Maidan)&t=h" rel="geolocation">Pragati maidan</a>” (place where expo was held in Delhi) I was offered a newspaper named “Connexxion Plus” which is published every fortnight. It contained many advertisements from the top companies like Dell, <a title="HTC Corporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Corporation" rel="wikipedia">HTC</a>, Toshiba, Intel and was basically featuring latest technical news. Although it costs Rs.15 in the market but we were offered it for free.

As I had already registered online I just had to tick some check boxes to get my Visitor Card from the registration booth.

The free newspaper was just the beginning, I was offered a lot of pamphlets, bookmarks and even hand bags.

This was not like other fairs where one has to deal with the hustling crowd, the stalls were well organized and there was plenty of room to move around. I started with the stall of “WD” products featuring Portable hard disks, media players. The volunteers present there were very attentive and made sure that the person looking at their stall is taken care of. The one at this stall told me about the prices and capacity of their product called “My Book Mirror” in which one can store data from 1TB-2TB.

Next was a Chinese company called “Trus” which featured really attractive USB flash disks and <a title="Solid-state drive" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" rel="wikipedia">solid state disks</a>. They were uniquely creative with the designs of the USB disks which came in different shapes.

Another company with similar creativity was “Touchmate”. They experimented with the designs of  IT peripherals and digital lifestyle products. Some of the good ones included, Home theatre with touch panel, Polarized MP3 sunglasses, DVD Boombox and rechargeable MP3 speakers.

Being a fan of movies, the stall featuring projectors gained my attention at once. The company called “Boxlight” provides various kind of projectors including ProjectoWrite2 which came with the interactive white board technology. The person could interact with the whiteboard using the wand or pen without even touching it. Actually the colour camera with I/R filter mounted on the projector allows for interaction with the wand and light pen. This would have been more interesting for me if I had not watched the video telling me about the cameras and sensors, so I just collected their pamphlet and moved on.

Another interesting thing were the <a title="Universal Serial Bus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus" rel="wikipedia">Mini USB</a> speakers featured by “advik”. Despite of their streamlined sleek design they provided high-efficiency with low distortion. These looked really easy to carry and had USB direct power supply connection convenience.

Next stall was of “HDRC” i.e. Hard Drive <a title="Data recovery" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_recovery" rel="wikipedia">Data Recovery</a>. Other than the recovery and cyber forensic services they were offering data recovery training as well. This included complete information on how to recover lost data in a secure and efficient way, so that one can make his own Data Recovery Lab. All the hardware products are being provided to the trainee along with online access. I think it is a nice way to build a career, as recovering data is considered to be most difficult and companies are ready to pay hefty amounts of money to get their data back from damaged drives.

I have used some online forms and databases lately and one of the websites that provides me such facility is “zoho.com”. They had their stall here providing online office, collaboration, business and productivity applications. Most of their applications are quite easy to use and give desired output. I will definitely suggest everyone to go through this website, as they give many services on trial basis.

We have been using scanners for different purposes, but we do have to bring our document to the scanner as we cannot carry our scanner to the document itself. Well, this is not the scenario anymore as the next stall of “Portronics” featured a portable <a title="Image scanner" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner" rel="wikipedia">handheld scanner</a> which was much like a stick. Instead of using a bulky scanner, now we can use this handy machine to scan our documents, photos, maps, textures and anything up to 50 inches. It is not supposed to be connected to any computer as the scanned images are stored in its internal storage (up to 32 GB), which can be later accessed via USB port. It runs on <a title="AA battery" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_battery" rel="wikipedia">AA batteries</a> and doesn’t require any drivers. I think it is a very useful device and can be quite helpful for scanning difficult areas.

A panel of computers is not a rare setting these days. And mostly it is not necessary for every terminal to have its own cabinet, especially for offices, banks, schools, internet cafes and factories. The company named “Sunde” was featuring thin client network computing using which one can extend a standard PC to a computing system with up to 40 users to work independently and simultaneously. Other than saving space and hardware cost it provides low power consumption with no noise output and no maintenance required. The device had all the required ports including Ethernet (RJ45), <a title="Video Graphics Array" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array" rel="wikipedia">VGA monitor</a>, USB, mouse, keyboard, mic and speaker. Moreover, it was designed in such a way that it could adjust between parallel and crossover cable automatically.

The companies often need a card printing machine and “Evolis” was featuring a similar portable color printer called Pebble, to personalize single-sided cards on demand or in volume. It provided large choice of consumables and encoding options like magnetic stripes, <a title="Identity document" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document" rel="wikipedia">ID badges</a>, payment cards, secured access control cards, driver’s licenses, health cards, transit passes, <a title="Loyalty program" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program" rel="wikipedia">loyalty cards</a>, event cards, contact smart cards and contact-less cards.
