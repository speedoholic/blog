Alarm was ringing, I was about to snooze it when I suddenly recalled I had to leave for the breakfast run. I threw away the blanket and jumped out of my bed as I was 40 min behind my schedule. After stuffing the backpack with an extra pair of clothes I left in haste. The distance (60km) which takes about 1:30 hours to cover was covered in just 50 minutes.

I was wearing a plastic sheet over my shirt and was soaked from gloves to socks because it was raining cats and dogs in the area I came from. I reached the meeting point on time and was so charged up (or rather lost I should say) that I applied the brakes at the very last moment which made my motorcycle skid in a drifting fashion. I was kind of embarrassed as it was perceived that stunts were not encouraged here at all. But I got over it as [Joshua](https://www.facebook.com/joshua.k.john) came and shook hands to welcome me. I mentioned that it wasn&#8217;t done on purpose. 

Soon, it was time to mingle with other riders as I started talking about usual stuff like whether it was their first run and all. To get rid of the wetness I changed at the rear side of the petrol pump. (This is where my extra pair of clothes got utilized) This also gave me the time to arrange my regular stuff like waist bag, camera, mobile phones, earphones and wrist watch etc. 

We just got the morning tea served when the Harley Davidsons and Suzuki Hayabusas drove in. It&#8217;s always a treat to eyes watching the HDs rolling. They parked the motorcycles with as much respect as they deserved and it was soon like an Auto-Expo with flashes coming from all the sides. Of course this was the time to draw out my digital camera and start clicking; and so I did:

I just couldn&#8217;t get enough of it as I kept clicking them from different angles:

My dream bike was right in front of my eyes; Hayabusa which was the fastest motorcycle (248 mph/397 kmph) in the world until the freaking Dodge Tomahawk (350mph/560 kmph) came in. (Although I don&#8217;t consider it as a motorcycle coz it&#8217;s more like a 4 tyre Quad)   
Then I heard a whistle and I knew it was party time. [Joshua](https://www.facebook.com/joshua.k.john) was standing on the pavement announcing the procedure and rules. Almost all the things were already mentioned in the message we all received on facebook; except from the fact that we were being served omelette in [Hodal](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kushalashok/sets/72157627037515825/). With all due respect to my favourite breakfast, I would like to add that I was very less excited about it, as there were some other things propelling in my mind already. 

We were supposed to drive in a 2X2 fashion with the headlights set at low beam. I was lucky enough to get space beside an HD whose pillion was a kid (as much equipped as the rider); and the whole setting seemed perfect. We drove together up to the next stop which was about 40km away from our destination and it was indeed a pleasure for me. 

This is where my friend [Sameer](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1179062068) joined us who suggested the HD&#8217;s logo to be clicked:

He was riding a Yamaha Fz and the helmet and gears gave him a pure wheeler look. We decided to get ahead of all so that we could record the campaign, and certainly we got a magnificent video recording (which I might be uploading after some editing). We reached Hodal in no time and managed to get these clicks:

Soon it was time to have the breakfast and we all moved into a hall where all the arrangements were already made. There I met the HD rider (whom I drove with) as he somehow recognized me. :/ He (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/tituskoshy" title="facebook profile" target="_blank">Mr. Titus Koshy</a>) was so down to earth and friendly that he earned my respect in no time. I told him about my trips to some hill stations like [Morni Hills](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kushalashok/sets/72157625939903775/), Chakrata, Tiger falls and Hatkoti as he listened patiently. I learned a lot from him as well. He told me about various things a biker should take care of. I even got a picture with him while we were coming back to Delhi:

Not to mention; he was not the only one who was humble and easy to break the ice with. As Sameer had to leave early, I talked with new mates and now I am having lot of new riders in my friend list. 

There was also a guy named &#8216;Swapnil&#8217; who made the environment quite musical by using his guitar and singing.

After the breakfast, we went outside to enjoy the view of lake where gooses were already waiting for my camera:

And then after stretching our backs we were ready to motor again. Although some of us went to different destinations like Agra and Vrindavan there were still many motorcycles lined up all smoking. This time I made sure that I&#8217;d be the last guy to leave as I wanted to get more photographs.

Although they vanished like mountain fog I reached them in no time. As it was getting hot I decided to get back to my usual driving style as I started taking over the lots. Although I did try to drive along the royal HDs for a while I guess me and [Vishal](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002162110716&ref=ts) were among the very first ones to reach Delhi. This was an unforgettable experience for me and perfectly served my motorcycling ardour.
