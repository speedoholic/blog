People are wasting a lot of money on choreographers these days. While all they do is to tell you the tricks and then let you practice on your own. Instead of paying such hefty amounts to them one can start learning from the internet; the ultimate source of almost everything.

Start by searching for videos on websites like [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com) and learn from the basics. There are a lot of videos available there which will tell you the easiest step in the best possible manner. As watching these videos is completely free so you are just spending the money for your internet connection and nothing else.

Once you get the basics you can also search for the text and image files which will be easily available on the search engines like [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com)
