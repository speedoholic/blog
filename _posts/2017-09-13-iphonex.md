### It‚Äôs around 4 AM in Shanghai and I have been up watching <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/">Apple‚Äôs September event</a> which took place at Steve Jobs Theater, and was streamed live. Though I did enjoy the announcements and demos related to other products like Apple Watch as well, I am writing this post to share with you, my top 3 reasons for buying an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/">iPhone X</a>; despite of it‚Äôs <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.apple.com/us/shop/goto/buy_iphone/iphone_x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.apple.com/us/shop/goto/buy_iphone/iphone_x">high price</a>. {.graf.graf--h3}

  <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Reason 1: Face ID</strong>
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  I have been reading the rumors and watching Youtube videos that rediculed this feature of the new iPhone X, but I was right to wait for the actual announcement where it got explained in more detail. If there is one thing that Apple has been able to convince the masses about; it‚Äôs security. So all those videos of people wearing a mask and making fun of this feature can literally be laughed at, once we read about the underlying technology and the kind of testing that has been performed by the engineers at Apple. Simply put in numbers, it is 20 times more secure than touch ID.
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  Just last week, one of my acquaintances asked me, ‚ÄúWhat if I pass out at a bar, and someone uses my thumb to unlock the phone and transfer all my money while I lay unconscious?‚Äù. Well, I bet opening the eyes of such a victim would be far more difficult than forcing his or her thumb.
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  In terms of accessibility, I think Face ID is going to open a whole new avenue for people with disabilities.

  <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Reason 2: Wireless Charging</strong>
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  From removal of the headphone jack, to removal of the home button, Apple has been making things cleaner and getting rid of all the moving parts. From my perspective, a machine with more movable parts is subject to more wear and tear. I like the haptic feedback based home button in iPhone 7, which feels far better than the traditional home button. Now with an all new glass design (the most durable glass ever in a smartphone, front and back. Surgical‚Äëgrade stainless steel), iPhone X allows wireless charging which is a game changer for many Apple fans.
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  After visiting manufacturing hubs like Huaqiangbei in Shenzhen, I am pretty sure that other companies would soon be manufacturing products like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/#wireless-charging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/#wireless-charging">AirPower Mats</a> to help Apple users charge their devices wirelessly (probably before the actual 2018 launch of mats by Apple).
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Reason 3: A11 Bionic Chip</strong>
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  To put it in simple terms, other than being faster and smarter while still providing slightly better battery life, this new chip would allow you to make use of features like machine learning (Face ID is one of it‚Äôs implementation), augmented reality (enjoy many AR games like Pokemon Go), animoji and real depth selfies (the new true depth camera along with A11 Bionic chip can analyze more than 50 of your muscle movements and create impressive photo effects)
