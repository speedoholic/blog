_I guess there are two parts of my heart:_

**1st part**( lets name it **Crack**): &#8220;Keep trying and may be you will be able to change the other heart!&#8221;

**2nd part**(lets name it **Jack**): &#8220;You ain&#8217;t strong enough to take the blows, back off!&#8221;

_Crack have been dominating since quite a while and now when the Jack&#8217;s turn has come, Crack is not ready to give away his throne._

Crack murmured, &#8220;There is still hope and giving up is not the way of living your life.&#8221;

Jack responded, &#8220;What do you know about the way of living one&#8217;s life? You are too confiscated with the false believes and hopes that you have stopped living your life the way you used to.&#8221;

&#8220;But change is the rule of nature, we can&#8217;t avoid it.&#8221;

&#8220;Shut up! Changing yourself to such an extent, just to be able to change another heart? Are you kidding me? You are not supposed to give a damn about such things.&#8221;

&#8220;But I will always regret not trying enough.&#8221;

&#8220;Regrets would have been more if you kept trying and nothing came out of it in the End.&#8221;

&#8220;But I have dedicated myself and now there is no turning back.&#8221;

&#8220;Okay you dumb piece of refuse, you can keep trying after we are done with the more important things. We have some responsibilities remember?&#8221;

_The **Brain** (lets name him **Mack**), enters_

Mack: &#8220;What are you two debating about? This never-ending quarrel has given me a headache. So just stop masquerading and get back to your primary work (i.e. pumping blood).&#8221;

Jack whispers, &#8220;See! He is completely under my spell now&#8221;

Crack sobbing, &#8220;You always win when it comes to the difficult part!&#8221;
