      Splendid suspenseful story about 3 lady doctors in California.<br /> The sense of humor was cynical. The twists and turns managed to outguess the unpredictable climax! The references to deaths were moderately detailed.<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Lasts-Forever-Sidney-Sheldon/dp/0446354732" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" title="Buy Now" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/nthng-lasts-forever.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="287" /></a><br /> Favorite scene: The trial<br /> Favorite character: Dr. Paige Taylor<br /> Favorite word: Goomer&nbsp;</p>

        P.S. : this medical thriller was assuredly a page turner!
