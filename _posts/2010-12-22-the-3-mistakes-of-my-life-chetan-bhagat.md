After reading his first book, I became a fan of <a class="zem_slink" title="Chetan Bhagat" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2746459/">Chetan Bhagat</a> and I bought his third novel, &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="The 3 Mistakes of My Life" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_3_Mistakes_of_My_Life">3 mistakes of my life</a>&#8220;. But I am sorry to tell that I am dissatisfied with his work in this novel. I lost my interest many times and the catchy moments were very less. His previous novel was far better than this one. The story was not that affective(very predictable) and thus came out to be a flop. I think chetan bhagat has made his 1st mistake with this novel. Some of my friends who don’t like his work from the beginning, call it as, &#8221; Ofcourse, its the 3rd mistake(novel) of his life&#8221;

**My rating: 4/10**
