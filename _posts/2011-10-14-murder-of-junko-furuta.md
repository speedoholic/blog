A 1988-89 incident in which a Japanese girl,[Junko Furuta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junko_Furuta "Junko Furuta") (古田順子 <a class="zem_slink" title="Murder of Junko Furuta" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta" rel="wikipedia">Furuta Junko</a>), 16 at that time, was not just [murdered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder "Murder") but was tortured to an extent that is un-imaginable.

I came across this photograph today:
  
[<img class="alignnone" title="junko-furuta-the-girl-who-went-through-44-days-of-torture" src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsxap99LQU1r0kb46o1_400.jpg" alt="junko-furuta-the-girl-who-went-through-44-days-of-torture" width="400" height="375" />](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsxap99LQU1r0kb46o1_400.jpg)

and when I googled the story, I read the complete account on <a title="Wikipedia article" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> which told, how those four hard-hearted brutes gang-raped her not just with their own bodies but with an assortment of foreign objects as well.

If you read the complete story at <a title="article on most amazing news.com" href="http://www.mostamazingnews.com/stories/real-life-story-of-junko-furuta-the-girl-who-went-through-44-days-of-torture/1907" target="_blank">MostAmazingNews</a>, you will surely think that such guys could not just be humans.

While I was going through the reference link of wikipedia article, I came across the <a title="Article at Japan Times" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20040729a3.htm" target="_blank">japantimes page</a> that told how the guy called Kamisaku who was one of the murderers only went through 8 years of prison. Even later in May 2004 he ended up wounding a male acquaintance. The girl&#8217;s parents were totally dismayed by the sentences received by the killers.

Though the names of these criminals were not to be revealed coz they were juveniles, a weekly magazine _[Shūkan Bunshun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungeishunj%C5%AB "Bungeishunjū")_ reported their real names, saying that &#8220;human rights aren&#8217;t needed for such animals.&#8221;
