I have been watching lot of <a class="zem_slink" title="Cinema of Korea" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Korea">Korean movies</a> lately. Of all the movies I watched, this one struck me the most. It is a heartwarming and tear tugging movie.

I decided to watch this movie when I saw the ratings (8.2/10) at <a title="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428870/" target="_blank">IMDB</a> and no doubt the ratings were given justly.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-566" title="moment_to_remember" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/moment_to_remember.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="430" />](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/moment_to_remember.jpg)It is the story of a girl who is betrayed by a man who is already married but plans to runaway with her. Soon she meets the real love of her life, a carpenter working under her father. The theme is based on <a class="zem_slink" title="Alzheimers Disease Stages" rel="webmd" href="http://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/alzheimers-disease-stages">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</a> which makes the girl forget things.

The intimacy between the couple really touched my heart. There are many great scenes and dialogues like..

**(Note: the following may contain spoilers)**
  
&#8220;_i have an eraser inside my head._&#8221;
  
*baseball scene where the girl is
  
confessing about her disease.

*letter of Su-jin to Chul-soo after she thought Chul-soo was her former BF.
  
*the ending scene where she remembered her family and when the guy
  
finally told her &#8220;_i love you!_&#8221;

and the best one:
  
&#8220;_<a class="zem_slink" title="Forgiving" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgiving">Forgiving</a> is giving your hate just a little room in your heart._&#8221;

I got so moved that I also created a lens at squidoo.com named, <a title="love and hate" href="http://www.squidoo.com/love-and-hatred" target="_blank">Love and Hate!<br /> </a>

Altogether it was an awesome romantic movie which lived up to my expectations and the status of South-Korean movies.
