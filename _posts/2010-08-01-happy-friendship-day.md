![friends](http://benliles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/friends-season.jpg)

This goes to all my friends!
  
Who may or may have not followed my trends!
  
Though they never asked me to amend!
  
Still I always got more to append!

They were the ones I loved to befriend!
  
Using their things, that they never commend!
  
All those lectures we bunked or attend!
  
All those rules we broke or just bend!

Visits to library to mess with bookend!
  
In all my fights, they were there to defend!
  
These are the fellas on which I depend!
  
God bless you all, I strongly intend!

Although, there is a lot more I can still blend!
  
I wish our friendship always ascend!
  
And may it never come to an end!
  
Coz I am gonna hit you if you ever offend! ðŸ˜‰

Happy <a class="zem_slink" title="International Friendship Day" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Friendship_Day">Friendship Day</a> to all my friends!!
