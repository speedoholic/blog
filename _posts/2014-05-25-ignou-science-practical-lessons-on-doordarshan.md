**I was going through different infotainment channels and came across some interesting practical science lessons that wereÂ demonstrated by a professor at IGNOU on Doordarshan.Â Impressed by the simplicityÂ and academic importance of these lessons I decided to create a blog postÂ dedicated to them.Â This can help teachers inÂ makingÂ their students learn some scientific facts in a quick and easyÂ manner.</p>

**Methyl alcohol canon**
  
AttachÂ twoÂ bottles to make a canon. Make aÂ hole in the lower one. Fill Methyl alcohol in the top bottle and push a rubber ball into it. Now use a lighter to warm up through the hole in lower bottle. The rubber ballÂ will be cannoned out.
  
This happens because methyl alcohol when reacts with air, makes waterÂ which turns into vapors and pushes the ball out with force.

**CellophaneÂ butterfly
  
** CutÂ aÂ piece of cellophane paper in the shape of a butterfly. Put this piece on your hand and you will see the butterfly raising her wings. Same will happen if you turn it upside down.
  
This happens because the paper absorbs moisture from yourÂ hand in its lower surface which expands and makes it look like the butterfly is raising her wings.

**Audio graph**
  
Tie a rubber balloon on top of an empty canÂ and paste a smallÂ mirror on it. Now speak from the other end of the can while you point a laser on the mirror which is to be reflected on a wall. You will get a graph of your voice&#8217;s turbulence displayed on the wall as the length of reflected laser light varies accordingly.

The singing bowl
  
** Take a brass bowl and hit it in center with aÂ rod. Now use the same rod to circle the bowl along itsÂ circumference andÂ it will slowly start create a singing sound. This happens because of theÂ _Mechanical energy_Â that gets produced in the bowl.

**The spinning top
  
** &#8220;Lattu&#8221; as we call it in India is a good example of teachingÂ _gravitational force_ to students.
