This is what I ended up creating after going through the <a title="Youtube Bootcamp" href="http://www.youtube.com/yt/creators/viewership-bootcamp.html" target="_blank">youtube bootcamp</a> and pondering over the brand identity I would like to create for myself.  Though it is totally unrelated to the learnings I got from the camp, it somehow landed on me that one of the best visual experiences that I have showcased are info graphics. And though I started by looking for a template that could help me with the creation of my youtube channel art / banner; I eventually created this infographic that depicts some facts about me. This includes my introduction as a mobile application developer, my college CGPA, a breakdown of my activities and work.
  
I have even included my current typing speed which helps me create content while living up to my alias name <a title="Twitter Alias" href="http://twitter.com/speedoholic" target="_blank">@speedoholic</a>.
