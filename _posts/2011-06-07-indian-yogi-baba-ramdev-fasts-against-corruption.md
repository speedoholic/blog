A few days back I saw the <a title="bbc news" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13652185" target="_blank">BBC headline</a>: “Indian yogi Baba Ramdev fasts against corruption.”
  
Now what image of our country does it draw?

I cannot deny that <a class="zem_slink" title="Corruption in India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India" rel="wikipedia">corruption in India</a> has caused so many problems that people are no longer ready to bear it. Thus, when such strikes are organized the people get to see a ray of hope that maybe, just maybe this time some things will change.

The way I see it, Baba Ramdev is surely a good <a class="zem_slink" title="Yoga" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga" rel="wikipedia">Yoga</a> educator but when it comes to events like these, it’s perplexing to understand who is telling the truth. I do not understand whether the sympathy people are having for Baba Ramdev is purely based on his effort to evade corruption or they are being hypnotised or something. He sure has a great following due to his remarkable achievements in the field of meditation and Yoga. But this makes it difficult to believe that people who follow him are actually against corruption or do they just want to agree with their hero.

There is <a title="controversy" href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/midnight-swoop-by-police-ends-ramdev-camp/156798-3.html" target="_blank">controversy in every little statement</a>. Viz. Baba Ramdev says that thousands were injured owing to the wipe off organized by police; while authorities count injured as 30. Now how bad someone&#8217;s math can be?

I also heard about the proofs that some harmful events like bomb-explosion were being planned, by those who are always awaiting such opportunities when mass number of people can be affected.

Several upshots like these made it clear that the agitation could not be allowed especially in a city none other than the capital of India; and thus it somehow defends the police action. Moreover, according to reports the tear gas was only being used after the violent agitation by supporters. If this was true, then Baba Ramdev should have just got down from the stage and hand himself over to the police because he was already given a warning on Saturday night. This would have saved the thousands of people who got beaten brutally by the police; according to the contradictory reports.

Now if we assume that all the <a title="followers of baba ramdev" href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/ramdev-asks-followers-to-agitate-against-police/156799-3.html" target="_blank">claims made by Baba Ramdev’s supporters</a> are true, then surely the police’s action cannot be justified at all. Making an announcement is  the foremost thing that is required in such a situation, where there are high chances of stampede. But it is hard to believe that Indian police could have acted like <a title="jallian wala bagh wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre" target="_blank">Jallian wala Bagh</a>&#8216;s troops; because for one thing, <a class="zem_slink" title="Reginald Dyer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Dyer" rel="wikipedia">General Dyer</a> is not alive anymore.

Other than this, the never-ending fight between the two political parties has given this a totally divergent picture. What was supposed to resemble a “satyagrah”, wouldn&#8217;t have involved such comments being made by the politicians’ one after the other.

There is a huge difference in the ways of Mr. Anna Hazare (associated with <a title="jan lokpal bill" href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/what-is-the-jan-lokpal-bill-why-its-important-96600" target="_blank">Jan Lokpal Bill</a>) and Baba Ramdev. For instance, the Ramlila Maidan was being booked for carrying out Yoga and not for any agitation. Breaking the rules (under section 144) in the first place made me think more about the ethnicity of this so-called ‘Fight against corruption’.

Wake up dude! We are not being ruled by a foreign company now; the people we are pointing our fingers at are the ones being elected by us only. We the people of India are responsible for its past, present and future.

For me, fighting against corruption is not going on a hunger strike but to eradicate it from the roots whilst we start from the leaves; the leaves that we have watered for our own sakes.

 _P.S.: All that I have written here is purely based on the knowledge that I received from the news reports. Now we all know about the preciseness of such reports, so maybe the way I am thinking now is also a result of the ideas being implanted in my brain by such manipulated compositions._
