The movie gets boring or I can say stays boring all the way. Rhitik was like a candy thrown in front of his fans to make them watch this awful movie. The actress was like: &#8220;bla bla bla..&#8221; to me all the time.
  
The music is good and loved by the people. Story sucks and so does the acting. One falls out of interest very soon. The actions was not good enough even after trying to put all those stunts there. Even the flips during the dance were not looking original at all.
  
Its a one time watch movie don&#8217;t go to a theater to waste your money on this. Better watch it on TV if you still want to.
