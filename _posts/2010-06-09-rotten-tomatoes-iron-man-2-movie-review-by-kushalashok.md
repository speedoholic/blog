Was expecting a lot from this movie, as I loved the entertaining first movie that came before it(Iron man).
  
Robert Downey was as good as ever, I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off Scarlett Johansson. She is bold and beautiful. I would suggest you all to watch &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; before laying your hands on this sequel.

These movies will always be loved by engineers. And that&#8217;s one of the reasons I love them.
