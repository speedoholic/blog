As I told in my last post..[Want to meet old friends]. I had a plan to meet my friends today. But I couldn&#8217;t convince my parents to allow me to go. As a result, I was suppose to go shopping with them. Although, I wasn&#8217;t in a mood for shopping after this disapproval. We left for Delhi at around 2pm.

I buttered my Dad, and he allowed me to drive the car today. After getting some house related work done, we went to Kamla Nagar. At first, I didn&#8217;t like it there but as I started roaming around in the streets, I got carried away by the crowded and beautiful lanes of Delhi. [<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-121" title="cp" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/cp.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="189" />](http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/cp.jpg)

Soon I started taking interest in the goods my parents wanted me to buy. We went through the whole market approximately. I was enjoying it a lot because I was in the markets of Delhi after a very long time. The crowd was fantastic and I passed time by looking at delhites and their trends while my parents selected the items on shops. After trying out some of the showrooms I finally bought a pair of blue colored action shoes. I have got 10 weeks guarantee on it and I was very happy with the sole.Â  I drove back to home at a faster speed, though my father was not comfortable with it. He shouted on me when I rushed the car through a busy lane cutting away a few slower bugs.

But at the end of the day, I am glad that I went with my parents today. Also, I came to know that even if they would have allowed me to go I wasn&#8217;t in huge profit, because my best friend Raicky was suppose to go to Rohtak in the afternoon and this meant that our get together couldn&#8217;t last long.

I miss my life in Delhi a lot. Those busy lanes, those branded stuff showrooms, those happy faces, those traffic lights, the enchanting Delhi radio and last but not the least, those pretty Delhi girls ðŸ˜‰_
