This happened to me recently when I watched the new release by <a class="zem_slink" title="Imtiaz Ali (director)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imtiaz_Ali_%28director%29" rel="wikipedia">Imtiaz Ali</a>, &#8220;Rockstar&#8221;.

I have listened to the songs since the audio release and had already become a fan.
  
So, I was ready to spend my bucks blindly just to know what goes between those songs. The most effective song is &#8220;Kun faya Kun&#8221; which depicts how God is there for us, even when the world turns away.
  
Another song called &#8220;Sadda Haq&#8221; is an adrenaline-pumping master-piece. Just watch the videos below to understand what I am talking about.

The movie completely lived up to my expectations as I laughed on Janardhan Jakhar, smiled on the naughty talks between the duo and felt my heart sinking as JJ aka Jordan walks through his simple life to a successful yet painful one.

The stars Ranbir(Jordan) and Nargis(Heer) made a perfect combo and portrayed ground-breaking chemistry between the characters.

Heer&#8217;s bucket list to be kicked off before her marriage includes the weirdest tasks to do and just if you have enough luck with you, trying this out is surely a great option.

Even though some people find problems with the plot and didn&#8217;t like the end, I for one have no complaints at all.
  
It includes all the things that I like in a typical Bollywood movie, viz. effective comedy, romance that can make you feel butterflies in your stomach, beautiful song lyrics with even more beautiful cinematography, a heart-break and the vulnerability of pain.

If you think that it missed &#8216;action&#8217;, then go and watch movies like <a title="scarface imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/" target="_blank">scarface </a>or <a title="death race imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452608/" target="_blank">death race</a>. Don&#8217;t try to get all things in a single go or you may end up watching a movie like <a class="zem_slink" title="Ra.One" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562871/" rel="imdb">Ra-one</a> which seems to be a flux of all super-hero movies.

So if you think you have a similar taste as that of mine, then go ahead and watch it.
