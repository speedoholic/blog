Gone are the days when you had to install different apps for taking care of different needs like finding the location of nearest grocery store or the best deal on mobile phones or searching the contact number of the local apple store. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GetIt" title="Askme on playstore" target="_blank">Askme</a> takes care of all your daily needs and gives you the smart tips that your smartphone was built for. The smartness with which it finds appropriate results for you is magical. If you have ever downloaded an app which helps you find local businesses, you must have noticed that search results are not very relevant, especially when it comes to businesses which are less common. But Ask me gives you the results which you were looking for. To make this possible, the results have been divided into three sections: 

 <img class="alignnone" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/0rk_Si3_dl_TZj1fPbE1Rd6D5L48zCyHVzGbSCPdYny57vjAp3jzpKNJDdZcdSkGRYg=h900" alt="Search results for askme" width="225" height="400" /> <img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/laWwzdpNPSlWeuzeBqalnMr_c495_S6EOSQ8Y_XUPW45ejbJOT8vkExT-xHtoJBhRA=h900" alt="Coupons page" width="225" height="400" /><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/EzLSH0ySWpHYf3X2qZTukYTA07vR5xStF4a3dgHRbw2g5yGLtfgCtag8E6n6EMQqZA=h900" alt="Share options" width="240" height="400" />

**ASKME:** This section only displays the list of businesses which are searched from within the database of askme. Millions of businesses across various cities have been added to this database which makes sure that you are provided the best results.
  
**FREEADS:** This section only displays the advertisements that have been added for free by various businesses or people like you. Keeping them in a separate section makes sure that your primary search results are not hampered.
  
**DEALS:** In the age of discount coupons, finding a deal can be more important than simply finding the nearest business or store. For instance, if you want to buy a mobile phone, finding the nearest mobile store will be less important than finding the best deal available in the market.
  
In spite of the above results, if you are still unable to find what you need, all you need to do is tap on the last option available on your search result screen and AskMe experts will help you further. This facility might be quite handy especially when you are not able to think of the relevant search terms which are most important for finding the best results. This scenario is quite common in India due to the variation in ways different languages are used.

Once you have the list of businesses, you need to identify which one of them suits your needs. Even the list of relevant results can be pretty long which makes the task of narrowing it down quite tiresome. Hit and trial, may not always work in case of common businesses. But don&#8217;t worry, Askme is not going to leave you there. It also provides its users, the ability to add reviews and these reviews help you determine which business is most suitable for you.

The next step after finding the required business is to call them up. Askme makes it fairly easy to make that call by providing you a call option right next to the listed item. Also, you can share your findings with you friends via Facebook, Whatsapp, Email, Google hangout or Bluetooth. The fact that this particular app has replaced 3 apps on my smartphone, indeed makes it the Bapp of all apps. And yes, this application can be installed for free. I think now I am getting it, why Ranbir Kapoor is so confident about it.
