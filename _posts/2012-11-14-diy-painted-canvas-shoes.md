I bought a pair of canvas shoes for attending the <a title="Join Indian Army" href="http://joinindianarmy.nic.in/inner.aspx?status=l1&menu_id=19&id=1" target="_blank">SSB interview</a> but I couldn&#8217;t find much use of them later. Thus I decided to experiment with them.
  
I started off with some pencil markings and made a rough design and then used <a title="flipkart" href="http://www.flipkart.com/camlin-water-color-paint-bottle/p/itmd7sgnfajzzbhp" target="_blank">water colors</a> to get it done.

They look good to me and are working fine with their color as is.
