  Being an android user, I get to choose from a large pool of options when it comes to mobile gaming applications. While going through some new launches, I came across this game called Flarry Harry. Though The name of the game is itself a USP for it, there are various other things that make me play this game from time to time. This post is to state all those reasons and present to you the importance of simplicity.
</p>

**1) It&#8217;s Easy!**

****In the virtual age of gaming, we are getting into more and more complex gaming scenarios, but if you look at the recent trends, people who are working in a multinational company, or those who are quite busy with their ongoing schedules, seldom take out time to play such challenging games. If they are supposed to go through some tutorials and brush up their skills before they could enjoy the game, the point of gaming for taking their time off gets destroyed. On the other hand, Flarry Harry is an android game that is easily understandable and is still quiteÂ inviting. All you have to do is tap your fingers timely and enjoy the journey crossing the hurdles one after the other.

**2) It&#8217;s Small**

The <a title="android central" href="http://forums.androidcentral.com/general-news-discussion/264442-whats-file-size-high-end-android-games.html" target="_blank">high-end games </a>that we talked about in the last point can usually range anywhere in size from 50 MB to 4146MB, as other than the hosted app, they can also use 2 expansion files which are again limited to 2GB each. This makes the installation process quite cumbersome. Also, when you decide to uninstall the files, you have to get rid of all the temporary files and expansions as well. But when we talk about Flarry Harry, the application occupies a mere space of 3.1 MB on your phone. This in turn ensures that your phone&#8217;s performance will not get affected due to the installation as it is occupying very less memory.

**3) It&#8217;s Free**

The best thing about most of the popular android applications is that they are free and so is Flarry Harry. That is the reason, android users are so satisfied with the market as they always find an application that meets their requirements and gets installed for free. So unlike apple market, users don&#8217;t have to use their credit cards and a simple click of a button will get them what they want. In addition to this, web users can also browse through the applications at the <a title="Google Play" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.harsh.flarryHarry&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and click on Install button if their phones have been configured with the same account as the one they are using for logging in online.

This game is one of a kind and will surely remain installed in my phone for a long time. I like to get involved with it when I get free time, whether it be standing in a queue, travelling far distances and sometimes even while attending unimportant calls; if you know what I mean ;). Kudos to the <a title="LinkedIn profile" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/62harsh" target="_blank">developer</a>!
