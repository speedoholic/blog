This movie was recommended to me by my friend. The story line was good and the music was lovely. The direction was superb at some moments.

I was bit annoyed with the excessive repetition even though they might be necessary for the movie to build up a good background.

The mother&#8217;s role emotionally touching, it tells us what we do to our parents when they get old and how they must feel when they are left alone.

Drug addiction is shown in a very good manner, one can learn a lot from this movie.

Stay away from Drugs&#8230;!
