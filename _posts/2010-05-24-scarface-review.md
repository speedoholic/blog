_I watched this movie because it was strongly suggested by my friend, Digvijay. And here I am writing about it gladly:_

This movie is all about guts and power. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" target="_blank">Al Pacino </a>has done a marvelous work and played the character very well. May be that is one of the reasons that the Great Al Pacino is admired by the Bollywood king <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Bachchan" target="_blank">Amitabh Bachan</a> himself.

When I watched Scarface, I got greatly influenced by Al Pacino. His style and acting just carried me away.

Talking about the character he played in this movie, I learned a lot from it. And the following line is enough to tell what I mean:
  
**&#8220;All that I came into this world with are my balls and my words&#8221;**

P.S.=We should live up to our words, always speak the truth, and success will be on our side.
