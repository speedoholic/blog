The word of mouth that I have been getting from all those who watched this movie before me turned out to be true. The movie had an awesome plot and was jumbled very appropriately so that the audience can try connecting the dots while the climax is being planned differently. The comedy elements were placed nicely; for instance, the deplorable guest house in which the main character (Vidya Balan) was staying had a board saying “Running hot water”. Thus, when the manager was asked why there is no hot water in tap, he explains very plainly that it is delivered to the rooms by a kid who RUNS with a hot kettle in his hand and thus it’s called “Running Hot water service”. The humor was also tried with the name ‘Vidya’ being translated as ‘Bidya’ by the <a class="zem_slink" title="Kolkata" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=22.5697222222,88.3697222222&spn=0.01,0.01&q=22.5697222222,88.3697222222%20%28Kolkata%29&t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Kolkata</a> people.

The quick shots that were showcased in the beginning as well as during some of the songs, were very impressive and showcased <a class="zem_slink" title="Culture of India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_India" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Indian culture</a> the right way. From local vendors to the school kids all the routine activities that can be seen in an Indian metro city were demonstrated well.

On one side there were people like the taxi driver and the police officer ‘Rana’ who were kind enough to offer help to a pregnant woman. While on the other hand officers like “Khan” depicted the hauteur and arrogance towards the inferiors.

Vidya has done a praiseworthy job and the emotions of a wife and a mother were very well addressed. Again the shots that accompanied the corresponding scenes were well planned. For instance, during one of the songs there was focus on ‘kids with their parents’ which was well connected with the story.

The feelings that ‘Rana’ builds up for ‘Vidya’ are demonstrated at few points and were handled very well towards the end as he offers Vidya a saree on behalf of her husband.

The last thing I would like to add is that while being a suspenseful flick, this movie not only exhibited the Indian culture but also gave a message that Women can be very strong and impregnable indeed. The reference to ‘Ma Durga’ was made in the same context.
