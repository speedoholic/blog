**Happy B&#8217;day Bhaiya!
  
** 

First of all thanks a lot for your endless support and helps. (Especially maintaining secrets LOL)

**If I were to recall some of the memorable moments I would list them as follows:
  
** 

1) Sharing Maggi at Auli (the valley of flowers)

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/shekz1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-888" style="border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:2px;" title="Me and Shekhoo Bhaiya" src="http://kushalashok.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/shekz1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a>
</p>

2) Planning extended trips from Bhimtal (hideously) ðŸ˜‰

3) Playing play station all night

4) Bunking a marriage to watch movie (Prince of Persia) ðŸ˜›

5) Me bunking preparations of YOUR marriage to watch a movie with your friends ðŸ˜€

And a lot more which are countlessâ€¦

**Well, after being on so many trips with you I can surely say that you are my favourite travel-mate who would never back down no matter what the change of terms is.
  
** 

**From being a mentor while you supervised me with work, to being a friend who never showed any lordliness, you have been playing all the roles perfectly.
  
** 

**I hope this brotherhood of ours goes on like this forever!
  
** 

Wishing you all the success and happiness ðŸ™‚

Your Bro ^_^
