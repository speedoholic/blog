Tonight I delivered a prepared speech at Toastmasters club after several months. It was my 19th (ACB9) Speech as per Toastmasters International education system; project 4 of Technical presentations manual, which provided me 12 minutes of stage time. You can refer to the slides which I used during the presentation, by using this link: [Mobike PPT](http://34.229.211.245/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mobike.pptx)

Also find below the link to white paper which inspired me to choose this topic:

<a href="https://mobike.com/global/public/Mobike%20-%20White%20Paper%202017_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobike White Paper 2017</a>

In terms of experience, I got an engaging audience and all of them had used Mobike before. Thus, it was quite easy for me to get their attention. I was worried that I may have included too many technical terms for everyone to understand, but I believe it went well since I got voted as the best prepared speaker. I think the inclusion of a poster from movie &#8220;3 idiots&#8221; successfully brought back nice memories for everyone.

I also got a nice feedback from my evaluator and she rightly mentioned that I could not summarize the speech to reiterate the key take away since I ran out of time. The agenda of this speech was not to publicize or praise Mobike, but to inspire people to learn and investigate more about the machines they use in their daily lives. To have that curiosity and zeal, to find the answers, and more importantly; to ask questions.

I also got some feedback from the Grammarian on my pronunciation, which reminded me that I still need to work on it. It gave me another reason to continue delivering more speeches at Toastmasters clubs.

_P.S.: I used the word of the day (in retrospect) twice, once in my prepared speech and once during table topics._
