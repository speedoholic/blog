I almost fell in love with the characters and the way relationships were explained. This novel was about the <a class="zem_slink" title="Near death experience" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_death_experience">near death experience</a> of a girl named Bree who lives independently in a small town called <a class="zem_slink" title="Panama" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=8.96666666667,-79.5333333333&spn=10.0,10.0&q=8.96666666667,-79.5333333333%20%28Panama%29&t=h">Panama</a> and falls in love with a famous writer from <a class="zem_slink" title="New York" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.0,-75.0&spn=3.0,3.0&q=43.0,-75.0%20%28New%20York%29&t=h">New york</a>. The most interesting parts were the intimacy between Bree and Tom. The emotions were expressed in the best possible way and I could feel the warmth of it. The story revolves around the three wishes Bree gets after her accident. Although the storyline didn’t strike much, it was a ripe novel altogether. At some point I felt that suspense was not good enough but that’s because the genre was more romantic than thrilling.

**My rating: 7/10**

**Favourite Character: Bree**
