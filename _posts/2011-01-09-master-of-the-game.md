Of all the novels I have read, none contained a chronicle of 4 generations. Although the story starts with the ninetieth birthday celebration of <a class="zem_slink" title="Kate Blackwell" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Blackwell">Kate Blackwell</a>, it moves 100 years back to Jamie MacGregor. First, his ambition for finding diamonds is explicated while he gets thirsty, tired, beaten and duped. He takes his revenge with the help of his friend Banda who didn&#8217;t seem friendly at first but came out to be the common hater of their rival Van Der Merwe who stole Jamie&#8217;s diamonds and killed Banda&#8217;s younger sister.

This was just one break up of the story and there are many more characters involved.

P.S. : All in all, it is a full-fledged novel which teaches us about hatred, revenge and manipulation.

**My rating: 8/10**

Favorite character: **Kate Blackwell**
