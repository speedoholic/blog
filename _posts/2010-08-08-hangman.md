Just watched the movie &#8220;hangman&#8221;(India), too much of emotional stuff! I am sure most of us won&#8217;t be able to stand it because even I wanted to throw out the CD, at the beginning! The feelings of parents are very well depicted!
  
And the thing that makes this movie unique is that the ending wasn&#8217;t altered even though such things are very indifferent in Indian movies.
  
The theme is good and message is passed quite well to the audience.

**My advice to all my friends:** 
  
&#8220;just try not to get in to stuff! If you can watch this movie, you will realize how wrong you can be!&#8221;_
