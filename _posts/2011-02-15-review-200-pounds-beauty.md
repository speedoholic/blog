Yet another emotional cum <a class="zem_slink" title="Comedy film" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_film">comedy movie</a> is &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_Pounds_Beauty" target="_blank">200 Pounds Beauty</a>&#8220;. It is about a fat girl who used to sing at the back while a good-looking girl just had to pretend like she was singing on stage.This way, people loved her voice but adored the girl in front.

She goes through a whole body <a class="zem_slink" title="Plastic surgery" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery">plastic surgery</a> when she is no longer able to resist the criticism; gets beautiful but is not satisfied with herself as she has to lie and wear a mask all the time. She ends up telling the world about it, at her concert and brings the people face to face with the harsh reality of unfavorable judgments made by everyone.

This movie does tell us the importance of innocence over beauty; truth over lie; love over selfishness and relations over money!

_P.S.: Another excellent motion picture which makes your heart pound!_
