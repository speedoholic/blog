  <a title="facebook page" href="www.facebook.com/speedoholic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social networking</a> is one of my favorite online activities which includes real-time <a title="twitter profile" href="http://twitter.com/speedoholic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeting</a>. Reading novels and posting reviews on <a title="Goodreads profile" href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6893844-kushal-ashok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodreads</a> is among the other ones. I tried <a title="Dancing Portfolio on Behance" href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Dance-(favorite-extra-curricular-activity)/1437241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dancing</a> as well, which is one of my ways of balancing out my adrenaline rush and enjoying the music. And guess what is my profession: <a title="Another blog by Kushal dedicated to mobile technology" href="http://developfone.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Engineer</a>. But I don&#8217;t spend all my time in the air-conditioned office, I rather like to go out and do something that makes a difference and I call it an investment in our future. One of these activities is teaching the underprivileged children in the nearby slum area. I seldom miss a chance to volunteer and have worked with various NGOs and societies. I believe in the idea of excellent education for all children which is the vision of <a title="Blog by Teach for India campaign leader" href="http://corporatetotfi.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teach for India</a>.

    <strong>Motorcycling</strong><br /> I love to take risks and that’s why I like stunting. I believe in the quote, <em>&#8220;if four wheels move the body, two wheels move the soul&#8221;</em>. Now you can reckon how much I love my <a title="Motorcycling blog" href="http://kushalashok.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motorbike</a>. I’m d kind of guy who’ll be sneaking out of my bedroom at three o’clock in the morning to look at my bike.

    One can key me out as a <a title="Speedoholic – my twitter handle" href="http://kushalashok.wordpress.com/2012/12/29/speedoholic-my-twitter-handle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>speedoholic</strong></a>. When I sit on my bike and kick-start it, I get a strange feeling as if I were omnipotent.

  In photography, my interest prevails as I keep up my photostream on <a title="Kushal Ashok's flickr photo stream" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kushalashok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flickr</a>. Though with the advent of <a title="Instagram pictures" href="http://instagram.com/kushalashok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram </a> I started clicking more pictures by using a smartphone.

  I am going to put all about me and my thoughts on this blog, and I hope that you revel reading it.
