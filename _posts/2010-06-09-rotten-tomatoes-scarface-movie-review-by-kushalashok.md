When I watched Scarface, I got greatly influenced by it. The Great Al Pacino, who is admired by the Bollywood king Amitabh Bachan himself became my role model. His style and acting just carried me away.

Talking about the character he played in this movie, I learned a lot from it. And all I would write here is:
  
&#8220;All that I came into this world with are my balls and my words&#8221;

Yes, we should live up to our words and always speak the truth. And success will be on our side.
  
I would suggest you to watch this movie as soon as you can.
