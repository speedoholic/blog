For the next version, I will be working on the following functionalities:

  1. Login via Wechat
  2. Get important updates about Toastmasters as Notifications
  3. Re-design the application to make it more user friendly.
  4. Add a few lines about each role to help the first time role takers.
  5. Allow sharing of history via WeChat.

But for doing all of this, I require help. You can help me by doing any of the following:

  1. Crowdfunding the expenses related to WeChat authentication.
  2. Using the application in your meetings and sharing feedback.
  3. Providing content and functionality ideas which can be added to this app.

If you would like this application development to go further and can help in any of the above mentioned ways, please extend your support by dropping a mail to kushal.ashok@gmail.com
